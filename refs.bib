abstract = {Vascular calcification, long thought to result from passive degeneration, involves a complex, regulated process of biomineralization resembling osteogenesis. Evidence indicates that proteins controlling bone mineralization are also involved in the regulation of vascular calcification. Artery wall cells grown in culture are induced to become osteogenic by inflammatory and atherogenic stimuli. Furthermore, osteoclast-like cells are found in calcified atherosclerotic plaques, and active resorption of ectopic vascular calcification has been demonstrated. In general, soft tissue calcification arises in areas of chronic inflammation, possibly functioning as a barrier limiting the spread of the inflammatory stimulus. Atherosclerotic calcification may be one example of this process, in which oxidized lipids are the inflammatory stimulus. Calcification is widely used as a clinical indicator of atherosclerosis. It progresses nonlinearly with time, following a sigmoid-shaped curve. The relationship between calcification and clinical events likely relates to mechanical instability introduced by calcified plaque at its interface with softer, noncalcified plaque. In general, as calcification proceeds, interface surface area increases initially, but eventually decreases as plaques coalesce. This phenomenon may account for reports of less calcification in unstable plaque. Vascular calcification is exacerbated in certain clinical entities, including diabetes, menopause, and osteoporosis. Mechanisms linking them must be considered in clinical decisions. For example, treatments for osteoporosis may have unanticipated effects on vascular calcification; the converse also applies. Further understanding of processes governing vascular calcification may yield new therapeutic options for vascular disease.},

abstract = {Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the main platform for production of biotherapeutics in the biopharmaceutical industry. However, relatively little is known about the metabolism of CHO cells in cell culture. In this work, metabolism of CHO cells was studied at the growth phase and early stationary phase using isotopic tracers and mass spectrometry. CHO cells were grown in fed-batch culture over a period of six days. On days 2 and 4, [1,2-(13)C] glucose was introduced and the labeling of intracellular metabolites was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at 6, 12 and 24h following the introduction of tracer. Intracellular metabolic fluxes were quantified from measured extracellular rates and (13)C-labeling dynamics of intracellular metabolites using non-stationary (13)C-metabolic flux analysis ((13)C-MFA). The flux results revealed significant rewiring of intracellular metabolic fluxes in the transition from growth to non-growth, including changes in energy metabolism, redox metabolism, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and anaplerosis. At the exponential phase, CHO cell metabolism was characterized by a high flux of glycolysis from glucose to lactate, anaplerosis from pyruvate to oxaloacetate and from glutamate to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, and cataplerosis though malic enzyme. At the stationary phase, the flux map was characterized by a reduced flux of glycolysis, net lactate uptake, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway flux, and reduced rate of anaplerosis. The fluxes of pyruvate dehydrogenase and TCA cycle were similar at the exponential and stationary phase. The results presented here provide a solid foundation for future studies of CHO cell metabolism for applications such as cell line development and medium optimization for high-titer production of recombinant proteins.},

Calcification of the media is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The phenotypic and the molecular fingerprints of medial calcification in patients with diabetes and patients with chronic kidney disease are strikingly similar. While disturbances in divalent ion homeostasis have been proposed to play a role in calcification of the media in patients with chronic kidney disease, patients with diabetes have an apparently intact bone and mineral metabolism. Chronic kidney disease as well as diabetes are now recognized as pro-inflammatory states. This review will explore the pathobiology of medial vascular calcification, review the evidence for diabetes and chronic kidney disease as pro-inflammatory states, and discuss the role of inflammation as a mechanistic link that explains the similarities in phenotypic and molecular characteristics of medial calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease and patients with diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {The presence of skeletal hypomineralization was confirmed in mice lacking the gene for bone alkaline phosphatase, ie, the tissue-non-specific isozyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). In this study, a detailed characterization of the ultrastructural localization, the relative amount and ultrastructural morphology of bone mineral was carried out in tibial growth plates and in subjacent metaphyseal bone of 10-day-old TNAP knockout mice. Alizarin red staining, microcomputerized tomography (micro CT), and FTIR imaging spectroscopy (FT-IRIS) confirmed a significant overall decrease of mineral density in the cartilage and bone matrix of TNAP-deficient mice. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed diminished mineral in growth plate cartilage and in newly formed bone matrix. High resolution TEM indicated that mineral crystals were initiated, as is normal, within matrix vesicles (MVs) of the growth plate and bone of TNAP-deficient mice. However, mineral crystal proliferation and growth was inhibited in the matrix surrounding MVs, as is the case in the hereditary human disease hypophosphatasia. These data suggest that hypomineralization in TNAP-deficient mice results primarily from an inability of initial mineral crystals within MVs to self-nucleate and to proliferate beyond the protective confines of the MV membrane. This failure of the second stage of mineral formation may be caused by an excess of the mineral inhibitor pyrophosphate (PPi) in the extracellular fluid around MVs. In normal circumstances, PPi is hydrolyzed by the TNAP of MVs' outer membrane yielding monophosphate ions (Pi) for incorporation into bone mineral. Thus, with TNAP deficiency a buildup of mineral-inhibiting PPi would be expected at the perimeter of MVs.},

@article{Appel1995,
abstract = {1. The purpose of this investigation was to develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model for the interaction between an adenosine A1 receptor agonist and antagonist in vivo. The adenosine A1 receptor agonist, N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) and the antagonist, 8-cyclopentyltheophylline (CPT) were used as model drugs. The CPA-induced reduction in mean arterial pressure and heart rate were used as measurements of effect. 2. Four groups of eight rats each received 200 micrograms kg-1 of CPA i.v. in 5 min during a steady-state infusion of CPT at a rate of 0, 57, 114 or 228 micrograms kg-1 h-1. The haemodynamic parameters were continuously measured and frequent blood samples were taken to determine the pharmacokinetics of the drugs. 3. CPT had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of CPA and the baseline values of the haemodynamic variables. Furthermore, no clear antagonism by CPT was observed of the CPA-induced reduction in mean arterial pressure. However, CPT antagonized the effect on heart rate, and with increasing CPT concentrations, a parallel shift of the CPA concentration-effect relationship to the right was observed. 4. An agonist-antagonist interaction model was used to characterize the interaction quantitatively. On the basis of this model, the pharmacodynamic parameters of both CPA and CPT could be estimated. For CPA the values were (mean +/- s.e.): Emax = 198 +/- 11 b.p.m., EC50 = 2.1 +/- 0.7 ng ml-1, Hill factor = 2.3 +/- 0.6 and for CPT: EC50 = 3.7 +/- 0.3 ng ml-1 and Hill factor = 3.1 +/- 0.1. 5. It is concluded that the competitive agonist-antagonist interaction model may be of value to characterize quantitatively the pharmacodynamic interactions between adenosine A1 receptor ligands in vivo.},

This paper summarizes the rationale, existing clinical trials data, and other considerations relevant to combination therapy for osteoporosis. Combinations of antiresorbers (eg, estrogen plus bisphosphonates) produce greater increases in bone mass than either treatment alone. Conversely, combining anabolic agents (parathyroid hormone) with bisphosphonates does not produce additive effects. None of the existing studies are large enough to determine whether combination treatment reduces fracture risk to a greater extent than use of a single agent. However, it is certain that combination treatment will increase cost and likely that it will increase side effects and reduce therapy adherence. Given the absence of demonstrated fracture reduction benefit, increased cost and likely increase in adverse events, combination therapy is not currently recommended.},

In addition, cells cultured from the aortic wall formed calcified nodules similar to those found in bone cell cultures and expressed bone morphogenetic protein-2a with prolonged culture. The predominant cells in these nodules had immunocytochemical features characteristic of microvascular pericytes that are capable of osteoblastic differentiation.

MCA complements current studies of genomics and proteomics, providing a link between biochemistry and functional genomics that relates the expression of genes and gene products to cellular biochemical and physiological events. Thus, it is an important tool for the study of genotype-phenotype correlations. It allows genes to be ranked according to their importance in controlling and regulating cellular metabolic networks.

Here, we have studied phosphosubstrate catalysis by osteoblast-derived MVs at physiologic pH, analyzing the hydrolysis of ATP, ADP, and PP(i) by isolated wild-type (WT) as well as TNAP-, NPP1- and PHOSPHO1-deficient MVs. Comparison of the catalytic efficiencies identified ATP as the main substrate hydrolyzed by WT MVs. The lack of TNAP had the most pronounced effect on the hydrolysis of all physiologic substrates. The lack of PHOSPHO1 affected ATP hydrolysis via a secondary reduction in the levels of TNAP in PHOSPHO1-deficient MVs. The lack of NPP1 did not significantly affect the kinetic parameters of hydrolysis when compared with WT MVs for any of the substrates. We conclude that TNAP is the enzyme that hydrolyzes both ATP and PP(i) in the MV compartment. NPP1 does not have a major role in PP(i) generation from ATP at the level of MVs, in contrast to its accepted role on the surface of the osteoblasts and chondrocytes, but rather acts as a phosphatase in the absence of TNAP.},

abstract = {Weak or partial agonists induce less desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) than do strong agonists. However, there have been few attempts to relate partial agonism quantitatively with the various parameters of agonist-induced desensitization, and to elucidate the mechanisms involved. Our understanding of how the treatment of cells and tissues with partial agonists affects their capacity to activate receptors is based on continued progress in defining partial agonism and the mechanisms of desensitization in which protein kinases, phosphatases, endocytosis and recycling play various roles. In this review, current research concerning partial-agonist-induced desensitization of GPCRs and the nature of partial agonism is summarized, and an attempt is made to put the existing knowledge into a working hypothesis concerning the mechanisms that account for the reduced desensitization in response to partial agonists.},

@article{Collin-Osdoby2004,
abstract = {Vascular calcification often occurs with advancing age, atherosclerosis, various metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease, or in rare genetic diseases, leading to serious clinical consequences. Such mineralization can occur at various sites (cardiac valves, arterial intima or media, capillaries), involve localized or diffuse widespread calcification, and result from numerous causes that provoke active inflammatory and osteogenic processes or disordered mineral homeostasis. Although valuable research has defined many key factors and cell types involved, surprising new insights continue to arise that deepen our understanding and suggest novel research directions or strategies for clinical intervention in calcific vasculopathies. One emerging area in vascular biology involves the RANKL/RANK/OPG system, molecules of the tumor necrosis factor-related family recently discovered to be critical regulators of immune and skeletal biology. Evidence is accumulating that such signals may be expressed, regulated, and function in vascular physiology and pathology in unique ways to promote endothelial cell survival, angiogenesis, monocyte or endothelial cell recruitment, and smooth muscle cell osteogenesis and calcification. Concerted research efforts are greatly needed to understand these potential roles, clarify whether RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand) promotes and osteoprotegerin (OPG) protects against vascular calcification, define how OPG genetic polymorphisms relate to cardiovascular disease, and learn whether elevated serum OPG levels reflect endothelial dysfunction in patients. Overall, the RANKL/RANK/OPG system may mediate important and complex links between the vascular, skeletal, and immune systems. Thus, these molecules may play a central role in regulating the development of vascular calcification coincident with declines in skeletal mineralization with age, osteoporosis, or disease.},

abstract = {Patients with advanced cancers--particularly breast and prostate cancers--are at high risk for bone metastasis, leading to accelerated bone resorption and clinically significant skeletal morbidity. Bisphosphonates are effective inhibitors of bone resorption and reduce the risk of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases. The standard routes of administration for bisphosphonates used in clinical practice are either oral or i.v. infusion. Oral administration of bisphosphonates is complicated by poor bioavailability (generally <5\%) and poor gastrointestinal tolerability. First-generation bisphosphonates, such as clodronate (Bonefos; Anthra Pharmaceuticals; Princeton, NJ), must be administered at high oral doses (1,600-3,200 mg/day) to achieve therapeutic effects, which leads to poor tolerability and compliance with oral dosing regimens. Infusion of bisphosphonates is associated with dose- and infusion-rate-dependent effects on renal function. In particular, high bisphosphonate doses (e.g., 1,500 mg clodronate) can cause severe renal toxicity unless infused slowly over many hours. In contrast, the newer, more potent bisphosphonates effectively inhibit bone resorption at micromolar concentrations, and the small doses required can be administered via relatively short i.v. infusions without adversely affecting renal function. Zoledronic acid (Zometa; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.; East Hanover, NJ) is a new generation bisphosphonate, and the recommended dose of 4 mg can be safely infused over 15 minutes. The 90-mg dose of pamidronate (Aredia; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.) and the 6-mg dose of ibandronate (Bondronat; Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.; Nutley, NJ) require 1- to 4-hour infusions. Intravenous bisphosphonates require less frequent dosing (once a month) and are generally well tolerated with long-term use in patients with bone metastases. Zoledronic acid has demonstrated the broadest clinical activity in patients with bone metastases.},

abstract = {Bisphosphonates suppress osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and are widely used in the management of osteoporosis. Daily oral administration of alendronic acid and risedronic acid have been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. Once-weekly regimens with these bisphosphonates are pharmacologically equivalent to daily regimens. Regimens with treatment-free intervals longer than 1 week present an attractive therapeutic option as they may offer additional patient convenience and long-term adherence to treatment. However, until recently, such regimens, usually referred to as intermittent or cyclical, have not shown any convincing antifracture efficacy in clinical trials, probably because of the empirical manner in which the design of these regimens has been approached. Investigation of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of bisphosphonates may help in the design of effective intermittent dosage regimens. Bisphosphonates are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and about 50\% of the absorbed drug is taken up selectively by the skeleton, while the rest is excreted unaltered in urine. Bisphosphonates exert their action at the bone surface, where they are taken up by the osteoclasts during bone resorption. Therefore, when describing the pharmacokinetics of bisphosphonates in relation to the pharmacodynamics, the amount of bisphosphonate at the skeleton should be accounted for. Few of the reported clinical pharmacokinetic studies addressed this issue. This is partly due to the absence of study design elements to account for skeletal binding of the drugs. Pharmacokinetic studies have also been hampered by technical difficulties in determining the concentration of bisphosphonates in serum and urine. Moreover, most clinical pharmacokinetic (but also pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) studies have primarily used noncompartmental analysis, leaving out the distinct advantages of modelling and simulation techniques. Clinically, the primary action of bisphosphonates can be assessed by the measurement of biochemical markers of bone resorption. Recent studies indicate that the pattern of these markers during bisphosphonate treatment may be predictive of antifracture efficacy; however, only limited data are available for the development of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models that are able to predict the response of these markers to different treatment regimens with bisphosphonates. Recently, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models for response to bisphosphonates have been described and, at present, some of them are being used in the design of bisphosphonate regimens with long drug-free intervals.},

abstract = {Despite considerable progress in genome- and proteome-based high-throughput screening methods and rational drug design, the number of successful single-target drugs did not increase appreciably during the past decade. Network models suggest that partial inhibition of a surprisingly small number of targets can be more efficient than the complete inhibition of a single target. This and the success stories of multi-target drugs and combinatorial therapies led us to suggest that systematic drug-design strategies should be directed against multiple targets. We propose that the final effect of partial, but multiple, drug actions might often surpass that of complete drug action at a single target. The future success of this novel drug-design paradigm will depend not only on a new generation of computer models to identify the correct multiple targets and their multi-fitting, low-affinity drug candidates but also on more-efficient in vivo testing.},

We show that the expression of CD39/ENTPD1 in concert with CD73/ecto-5'-nucleotidase distinguishes CD4(+)/CD25(+)/Foxp3(+) T reg cells from other T cells. These ectoenzymes generate pericellular adenosine from extracellular nucleotides. The coordinated expression of CD39/CD73 on T reg cells and the adenosine A2A receptor on activated T effector cells generates immunosuppressive loops, indicating roles in the inhibitory function of T reg cells. Consequently, T reg cells from Cd39-null mice show impaired suppressive properties in vitro and fail to block allograft rejection in vivo. We conclude that CD39 and CD73 are surface markers of T reg cells that impart a specific biochemical signature characterized by adenosine generation that has functional relevance for cellular immunoregulation.},

Recently, lansoprazole has been found to be an inhibitor of cytosolic PHOSPHO1 (a phosphatase which hydrolyses phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine), providing a possible therapeutical target to cure pathological mineralization. Since PHOSPHO1 is present inside matrix vesicles, we tested the effect of lansoprazole on matrix vesicles containing several key enzymes for the mineralization process including tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. We found that lansoprazole can inhibit in an uncompetitive manner tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. A K(i) value of 1.74 +/- 0.12 mM has been determined for the inhibition of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase by lansoprazole. Lansoprazole, currently used for treating gastroesophageal disease, by inhibiting PHOSPHO1 and tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase could prevent hydroxyapatite-deposition disease and could serve as an adjunct treatment for osteoarthritis.},

abstract = {The process of vascular calcification presents several features similar to osteogenesis in which fibronectin (FN) acts as a regulator of osteoblastic differentiation and the ERK signal pathway is involved. In order to find whether FN promotes the osteoblastic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through the ERK signal pathway, we investigated the effect of FN on the calcification of VSMCs by using an in vitro cell model. VSMCs cultured in plates with FN (0-20 microg/cm2) coating were induced to calcify by 10 mM sodium beta-glycerophosphate (beta-GP). FN exacerbated VSMC calcification in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as indicated by the number of calcifying nodules per slide and the amount of calcium in the deposition. Data from RT-PCR and immunoblotting assay revealed that FN also enhanced the expression of several phenotypic markers of osteoblasts, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin (OC), and Osf2/Cbfa1, a key transcription factor in osteoblastic differentiation. Furthermore, a specific inhibitor for ERK, PD98059 (10 microM), significantly suppressed the effect of FN on calcification and phenotypic marker expression. These findings seem to suggest that FN enhanced vascular calcification by promoting the osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs via ERK signal pathway.},

We hypothesized that the concentration of extracellular ATP could be determined luminometrically by limiting degradation and measuring the free and protein-bound fractions. ATP was added (a) at constant concentration to solutions containing varying albumin concentrations; (b) at varying concentrations to a physiological albumin solution (4 gm/dL); (c) at varying concentrations to plasma. After centrifugation, a fraction of each supernatant was heated. ATP in heated and unheated samples was measured luminometrically. Blood was drawn into saline or an ATP-stabilizing solution and endogenous plasma ATP measured. ATP-albumin binding was a linear function of albumin concentration (3.5\% ATP bound at 100 micromol/L to 33.2\% ATP bound at 1000 micromol/L) but independent of ATP concentration (29.3\%, 10-1000 nmol/L ATP in 602 micromol/L albumin). Heating released the majority of bound ATP from albumin-containing solutions (94.8 +/- 1.7\%) and plasma (97.6 +/- 5.1\%). Total endogenous plasma ATP comprised 93 +/- 27 nmol/L (free) and 150 +/- 40 nmol/L (total fraction). Without stabilizing solution, degradation of free endogenous plasma ATP occurred. Within a physiological range (10-1000 nmol/L), ATP binds albumin independently of ATP concentration. Heating releases bound ATP, enabling accurate luminometric measurement of total extracellular ATP (free and bound) in biological samples.},

abstract = {Generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI, MIM\#208000) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by extensive calcifications in the media of large- and medium-sized muscular arteries. Most affected children die in early infancy because of cardiac failure. GACI is linked to mutations in the ENPP1 gene, which encodes for an enzyme that generates inorganic pyrophosphate (PP(i)), a potent inhibitor of hydroxyapatite crystal formation. Treatment with bisphosphonates, which are synthetic PP(i) analogues, has been proposed as a means of reducing arterial calcifications in GACI patients, but no formalized treatment approach exists. We report on the long-term survival of a severe case of GACI linked to a novel homozygous missense mutation c.583T/C in the ENPP1 gene, diagnosed prenatally, and treated with bisphosphonates. Intravenous disodium pamidronate (three infusions at days 8, 15, and 18 of 0.25, 0.50, and 0.50 mg/kg, respectively) was changed to oral disodium etidronate (starting dose of 20 mg/kg daily, 50 mg die) at 3 weeks of age. Although the etidronate dose was maintained at 50 mg daily in our patient (corresponding to a progressive decrease from 20 to 5 mg/kg daily), the progressive resolution of arterial calcifications seen by 3 months of age was maintained until 2 years of age. Throughout the 2-year follow-up, our patient developed mild hypophosphatemia, due to renal phosphate wasting, without clinical, biochemical, or radiological sign of rickets. Conclusion: High-dose bisphosphonate therapy may not be necessary for an extended period of time in children with GACI.},

In this review, we distinguish between two types of biological models--mathematical and computational--which differ in their representations of biological phenomena.

We survey the main modeling efforts in this direction, emphasize the applicability and benefits of executable models in biological research and highlight some of the challenges that executable biology poses for biology and computer science. We claim that for executable biology to reach its full potential as a mainstream biological technique, formal and algorithmic approaches must be integrated into biological research.

Majesky, and S. Schwartz. 1991. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 177:867-873). In this study, we sequenced the complete cDNA and conclusively identified one of these genes, 2B7, as rat osteopontin. Using immunochemistry and in situ hybridization, we found that medial smooth muscle cells (SMC) in uninjured arteries contained very low levels of osteopontin protein and mRNA. Injury to either the adult rat aorta or carotid artery using a balloon catheter initiated a qualitatively similar time-dependent increase in both osteopontin protein and mRNA in arterial SMC. Expression was transient and highly localized to neointimal SMC during the proliferative and migratory phases of arterial injury, suggesting a possible role for osteopontin in these processes. In vitro, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and angiotensin II (AII), all proteins implicated in the rat arterial injury response, elevated osteopontin expression in confluent vascular SMC. Finally, we found that osteopontin was a novel component of the human atherosclerotic plaque found most strikingly associated with calcified deposits. These data implicate osteopontin as a potentially important mediator of arterial neointima formation as well as dystrophic calcification that often accompanies this process.},

abstract = {Osteopontin is a secreted glycoprotein with a multidomain structure and functions characteristic of a matricellular protein. Osteopontin interacts with cell surface receptors via arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)- and non-RGD containing adhesive domains, in addition to binding to components of the structural extracellular matrix. While normally expressed in bone and kidney, osteopontin levels are elevated during wound healing and inflammation in most tissues studied to date. Since 1986, over one thousand studies have been published on osteopontin, including recent experiments in osteopontin-deficient mice. These studies reveal osteopontin as a cell adhesive, signaling, migratory, and survival stimulus for various mesenchymal, epithelial, and inflammatory cells, in addition to being a potent regulator of osseous and ectopic calcification. Based on these reports, a general picture of osteopontin as an important regulator of inflammation and biomineralization is emerging. A common denominator in osteopontin function in these situations is its ability to regulate the function of macrophage and macrophage-derived cells (i.e. osteoclasts). While we have learned much about osteopontin and the processes it appears to regulate over the past decade, many questions regarding this important multifunctional protein remain unanswered and provide important directions for future studies.},

abstract = {Vascular calcification is highly correlated with cardiovascular disease mortality, especially in patients with ESRD or diabetes. In addition to the devastating effects of inappropriate biomineralization seen in cardiac valvulopathies, calciphylaxis, and idiopathic arterial calcification, vascular calcification is now recognized as a marker of atherosclerotic plaque burden as well as a major contributor to loss of arterial compliance and increased pulse pressure seen with age, diabetes, and renal insufficiency. In recent years, several mechanisms to explain vascular calcification have been identified including (1) loss of inhibition, (2) induction of bone formation, (3) circulating nucleational complexes, and (4) cell death. Alterations in calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) balance as seen in patients with ESRD promotes vascular calcification via multiple mechanisms and may explain the alarmingly high levels of cardiovascular disease deaths in these patients. Strategies to control Ca and P levels in patients with ESRD have met with early success in preventing progression of vascular calcification. Whether or not vascular calcification can be reversed is not yet known, but exciting new studies suggest that this may be possible in the future.},

This agent is approved for the short-term treatment of erosive reflux oesophagitis, active gastric ulcer, active duodenal ulcer and the treatment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. It is also approved for the long-term treatment of healed reflux oesophagitis, healed duodenal ulcer, the treatment of hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and the eradication of Helicobacter pylori as a component of triple therapy with lansoprazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin, or dual therapy with lansoprazole and amoxicillin. Its mechanism of action is to selectively inhibit the membrane enzyme H+/K+ ATPase in gastric parietal cells. In clinical trials, lansoprazole is more effective than placebo or histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists in the treatment of reflux oesophagitis. Lansoprazole administered at a dose of 30 mg daily produced faster relief of symptoms and superior healing rates in patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers or reflux oesophagitis than H2-receptor antagonists. A daily dose of 30 mg lansoprazole reduced epigastric pain faster than omeprazole 20 mg daily in patients with peptic ulcer disease but healing rates at 4 and 8 weeks were similar with both agents at these dosages. Lansoprazole was more effective than H2-receptor antagonists in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and produced similar treatment outcome to omeprazole. Lansoprazole in combination with clarithromycin and amoxicillin produced similar rates of eradication of H. pylori. In clinical trials, lansoprazole is well-tolerated and has a low frequency of side effects similar to that of H2-receptor antagonists or omeprazole.},

abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions rather than on parameters.},

abstract = {The action of adenosine on the myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle strips from guinea-pig ileum to high frequency electrical field stimulation (10 Hz) was investigated. Electrically induced contractions were reduced markedly by tetrodotoxin (0.2 microM) and atropine (1 microM), and partially by noradrenaline (3 microM) and morphine (3 microM). Adenosine, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the high frequency contractions over the range of 0.1-100 microM, the most potent being adenosine. The concentration-response curve for adenosine was significantly shifted to the left by dipyridamole (10 nM), while dipyridamole at higher concentrations (30 nM-10 microM), depressed the contraction markedly by itself. Dipyridamole decreased [3H]-adenosine uptake into strips of ileum in a concentration-dependent manner. There was a significant correlationship between the reduction of adenosine uptake and the inhibition of the contraction induced by dipyridamole (r = 0.970). In strips desensitized to adenosine or treated with adenosine deaminase, the inhibitory effect of dipyridamole was significantly reduced. The present investigation revealed that adenosine depressed responses of guinea-pig ileum to high frequency electrical stimulation and suggested that the inhibitory effect of dipyridamole may be closely associated with the behaviour of endogenous adenosine or related compounds.},

abstract = {Seven-transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) are involved in nearly all aspects of chemical communications and represent major drug targets. 7TMRs transmit their signals not only via heterotrimeric G proteins but also through $\beta$-arrestins, whose recruitment to the activated receptor is regulated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). In this paper, we combined experimental approaches with computational modeling to decipher the molecular mechanisms as well as the hidden dynamics governing extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation by the angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT(1A)R) in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells. We built an abstracted ordinary differential equations (ODE)-based model that captured the available knowledge and experimental data. We inferred the unknown parameters by simultaneously fitting experimental data generated in both control and perturbed conditions. We demonstrate that, in addition to its well-established function in the desensitization of G-protein activation, GRK2 exerts a strong negative effect on $\beta$-arrestin-dependent signaling through its competition with GRK5 and 6 for receptor phosphorylation. Importantly, we experimentally confirmed the validity of this novel GRK2-dependent mechanism in both primary vascular smooth muscle cells naturally expressing the AT(1A)R, and HEK293 cells expressing other 7TMRs.},

abstract = {Hypophosphatasia is a heritable form of rickets/osteomalacia with extremely variable clinical expression. Severe forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion; the mode of transmission of mild forms is uncertain. The biochemical hallmark of hypophosphatasia is deficient activity of the tissue-nonspecific isozyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). Previously, we demonstrated in one inbred infant that an identical missense mutation in both alleles of the gene encoding TNSALP caused lethal disease. We have now examined TNSALP cDNAs from four unrelated patients with the severe perinatal or infantile forms of hypophosphatasia. Each of the eight TNSALP alleles from these four individuals contains a different point mutation that causes an amino acid substitution. These base changes were not detected in at least 63 normal individuals and, thus, appear to be causes of hypophosphatasia in the four patients. (Two additional base substitutions, found in one allele from each of the four patients, are linked polymorphisms.) Twenty-three unrelated patients (of 50 screened), who reflect the entire clinical spectrum of hypophosphatasia, possess one of our of the above eight mutations. In two of these additional patients, mild forms of the disease are also inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Our findings indicate that hypophosphatasia can be caused by a number of different missense mutations and that the specific interactions of different TNSALP mutant alleles are probably important for determining clinical expression. Severe forms, perinatal and infantile disease, are largely the result of compound heterozygosity for different hypophosphatasia alleles. At least some cases of childhood and adult hypophosphatasia are inherited as autosomal recessive traits.},

abstract = {Osteoblasts mineralize bone matrix by promoting hydroxyapatite crystal formation and growth in the interior of membrane-limited matrix vesicles (MVs) and by propagating the crystals onto the collagenous extracellular matrix. Two osteoblast proteins, tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) and plasma cell membrane glycoprotein-1 (PC-1) are involved in this process. Mutations in the TNAP gene result in the inborn error of metabolism known as hypophosphatasia, characterized by poorly mineralized bones, spontaneous fractures, and elevated extracellular concentrations of inorganic pyrophosphate (PP(i)). PP(i) suppresses the formation and growth of hydroxyapatite crystals. PP(i) is produced by the nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase activity of a family of isozymes, with PC-1 being the only member present in MVs. Mice with spontaneous mutations in the PC-1 gene have hypermineralization abnormalities that include osteoarthritis and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine. Here, we show the respective correction of bone mineralization abnormalities in knockout mice null for both the TNAP (Akp2) and PC-1 (Enpp1) genes. Each allele of Akp2 and Enpp1 has a measurable influence on mineralization status in vivo. Ex vivo experiments using cultured double-knockout osteoblasts and their MVs demonstrate normalization of PP(i) content and mineral deposition. Our data provide evidence that TNAP and PC-1 are key regulators of the extracellular PP(i) concentrations required for controlled bone mineralization. Our results suggest that inhibiting PC-1 function may be a viable therapeutic strategy for hypophosphatasia. Conversely, interfering with TNAP activity may correct pathological hyperossification because of PP(i) insufficiency.},

In vitro osteogenesis assays are routinely used to test osteoblastic responses to drugs, hormones, and biomaterials for bone and cartilage repair applications. These cell culture models recapitulate events that occur in woven bone synthesis, and are carried out using primary osteoblasts, osteoblast precursors such as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs), or various osteoblast cell lines. With time in culture, cell differentiation is typically assessed by examining levels of alkaline phosphatase activity (an early osteoblast marker) and by evaluating the assembly of a collagen (type I)-containing fibrillar extracellular matrix that mineralizes. In this review, we have made a comparative analysis of published osteogenic assays using calvarial cells, calvaria-derived cell lines, and bone marrow stromal cells. In all of these cell types, alkaline phosphatase activity shows similar progression over time using a variety of osteogenic and mineralizing media conditions; however, levels of alkaline phosphatase activity are not proportional to observed mineralization levels.},

abstract = {Imaging single fluorescent proteins in a live cell is a challenging task because of the strong cellular autofluorescence. Autofluorescence can be minimized by reducing fluorescence excitation volume. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy has been routinely used to reduce excitation volume and detect single protein molecules in or close to cell membrane. However, the limited penetration depth of evanescent field excludes imaging of single fluorescent proteins that reside deep inside a eukaryotic cell. Here we report detection of single fluorescent proteins inside eukaryotic cells by two-photon fluorescence (TPF) microscopy. TPF has an excitation volume less than 0.1 femtoliter (fL). Cell autofluorescence under TPF is low and thus enables us to detect single enhanced green fluorescent proteins (EGFP) and single monomeric teal fluorescent proteins (mTFP1.0) that reside several microns deep inside the cell. Discrete stepwise photobleaching of TPF was observed for both proteins inside the cell. Quantitative analysis of single-molecule fluorescence trajectories show that mTFP1.0 is about twofold brighter than EGFP, while its fluorescence on-time before bleaching is about 10 fold shorter. These findings demonstrate the sensitivity of TPF for imaging of eukaryotic cells at single-molecule level and will be useful for measurement of protein stoichiometry inside the cell.},

abstract = {AMP and adenosine are found in all cell types and can be released by cells or created extracellularly from the breakdown of ATP and ADP. We have identified an orphan G protein-coupled receptor with homology to the P2Y family of nucleotide receptors that can respond to both AMP and adenosine. Based on its ability to functionally bind the nucleotide AMP, we have named it P2Y15. Upon stimulation, P2Y15 induces both Ca2+ mobilization and cyclic AMP generation, suggesting coupling to at least two different G proteins. It is highly expressed in mast cells and is found predominantly in the tissues of the respiratory tract and kidneys, which are known to be affected by AMP, adenosine, and adenosine antagonists. Until now, the effects of AMP have been thought to depend on its dephosphorylation to adenosine but we demonstrate here that P2Y15 is a bona fide AMP receptor by showing that it binds [(32)P]AMP. Because AMP and adenosine have bronchoconstrictive effects that can be inhibited by theophylline, we tested whether theophylline and other adenosine receptor antagonists can block P2Y15. We found inhibition at a theophylline concentration well within the therapeutic dose range, indicating that P2Y15 may be a clinically important target of this drug.},

abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that extracellular guanosine regulates extracellular adenosine levels. Rat preglomerular vascular smooth muscle cells were incubated with adenosine, guanosine, or both. Guanosine (30 $\mu$mol/l) per se had little effect on extracellular adenosine levels. Extracellular adenosine levels 1 h after addition of adenosine (3 $\mu$mol/l) were 0.125 ± 0.020 $\mu$mol/l, indicating rapid disposition of extracellular adenosine. Extracellular adenosine levels 1 h after addition of adenosine (3 $\mu$mol/l) plus guanosine (30 $\mu$mol/l) were 1.173 ± 0.061 $\mu$mol/l, indicating slow disposition of extracellular adenosine. Cell injury increased extracellular levels of endogenous adenosine and guanosine, and the effects of cell injury on endogenous extracellular adenosine were modulated by altering the levels of endogenous extracellular guanosine with exogenous purine nucleoside phosphorylase (converts guanosine to guanine) or 8-aminoguanosine (inhibits purine nucleoside phosphorylase). Extracellular guanosine also slowed the disposition of extracellular adenosine in rat preglomerular vascular endothelial cells, mesangial cells, cardiac fibroblasts, and kidney epithelial cells and in human aortic and coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cells and coronary artery endothelial cells. The effects of guanosine on adenosine levels were not mimicked or attenuated by 5-iodotubericidin (adenosine kinase inhibitor), erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)-adenine (adenosine deaminase inhibitor), 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (guanine deaminase inhibitor), aristeromycin (S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor), low sodium (inhibits concentrative nucleoside transporters), S-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine [inhibits equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) type 1], zidovudine (inhibits ENT type 2), or acadesine (known modulator of adenosine levels). Guanosine also increases extracellular inosine, uridine, thymidine, and cytidine, yet decreases extracellular uric acid. In conclusion, extracellular guanosine regulates extracellular adenosine levels.},

abstract = {The majority of intracellular signalling cascades in higher eukaryotes are initiated by GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors). Hundreds of GPCRs signal through a handful of trimeric G-proteins, raising the issue of signal specificity. In the present paper, we illustrate a simple kinetic model of G-protein signalling. This model shows that stable production of significant amounts of free Galpha(GTP) (GTP-bound Galpha subunit) and betagamma is only one of multiple modes of behaviour of the G-protein system upon activation. Other modes, previously uncharacterized, are sustained production of betagamma without significant levels of Galpha(GTP) and transient production of Galpha(GTP) with sustained betagamma. The system can flip between different modes upon changes in conditions. This model demonstrates further that the negative feedback of receptor uncoupling or internalization, when combined with a positive feedback within the G-protein cycle, under a broad range of conditions results not in termination of the response but in relaxed oscillations in GPCR signalling. This variety of G-protein responses may serve to encode signal specificity in GPCR signal transduction.},

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease encompasses a range of conditions extending from myocardial infarction to congenital heart disease, most of which are heritable. Enormous effort has been invested in understanding the genes and specific DNA sequence variants that are responsible for this heritability. Here, we review the lessons learned for monogenic and common, complex forms of cardiovascular disease. We also discuss key challenges that remain for gene discovery and for moving from genomic localization to mechanistic insights, with an emphasis on the impact of next-generation sequencing and the use of pluripotent human cells to understand the mechanism by which genetic variation contributes to disease.},

abstract = {Enpp1 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that regulates bone mineralization by hydrolyzing extracellular nucleotide triphosphates to produce pyrophosphate. Enpp1 dysfunction causes human diseases characterized by ectopic calcification. Enpp1 also inhibits insulin signaling, and an Enpp1 polymorphism is associated with insulin resistance. However, the precise mechanism by which Enpp1 functions in these cellular processes remains elusive. Here, we report the crystal structures of the extracellular region of mouse Enpp1 in complex with four different nucleotide monophosphates, at resolutions of 2.7-3.2 \AA. The nucleotides are accommodated in a pocket formed by an insertion loop in the catalytic domain, explaining the preference of Enpp1 for an ATP substrate. Structural mapping of disease-associated mutations indicated the functional importance of the interdomain interactions. A structural comparison of Enpp1 with Enpp2, a lysophospholipase D, revealed marked differences in the domain arrangements and active-site architectures. Notably, the Enpp1 mutant lacking the insertion loop lost the nucleotide-hydrolyzing activity but instead gained the lysophospholipid-hydrolyzing activity of Enpp2. Our findings provide structural insights into how the Enpp family proteins evolved to exert their diverse cellular functions.},

Dinoflagellate luciferase was expressed on the surface of a mammalian cell as a chimeric fusion protein with a membrane protein of interest. Using a membrane-impermeable substrate to quantify the membrane-displayed luciferase, the expression of the membrane protein on the cell surface was determined. By inclusion of a quenching step for the luminescent activity of luciferase on the cell surface, we were able to monitor the membrane protein expression kinetics by measuring the luminescence recovery from the cell surface after quenching. The reported methods provide a convenient way to monitor the kinetics of expression and transport of membrane proteins to the cell surface. It is applicable to the high-throughput analysis of drugs or drug candidates concerning their effects on membrane protein expression.},

abstract = {Medial vascular calcification (MVC) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease, obesity, and aging. MVC is an actively regulated process that resembles skeletal mineralization, resulting from chondro-osteogenic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Here, we used mineralizing murine VSMCs to study the expression of PHOSPHO1, a phosphatase that participates in the first step of matrix vesicles-mediated initiation of mineralization during endochondral ossification. Wild-type (WT) VSMCs cultured under calcifying conditions exhibited increased Phospho1 gene expression and Phospho1(-/-) VSMCs failed to mineralize in vitro. Using natural PHOSPHO1 substrates, potent and specific inhibitors of PHOSPHO1 were identified via high-throughput screening and mechanistic analysis and two of these inhibitors, designated MLS-0390838 and MLS-0263839, were selected for further analysis. Their effectiveness in preventing VSMC calcification by targeting PHOSPHO1 function was assessed, alone and in combination with a potent tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) inhibitor MLS-0038949. PHOSPHO1 inhibition by MLS-0263839 in mineralizing WT cells (cultured with added inorganic phosphate) reduced calcification in culture to 41.8\% ± 2.0\% of control. Combined inhibition of PHOSPHO1 by MLS-0263839 and TNAP by MLS-0038949 significantly reduced calcification to 20.9\% ± 0.74\% of control. Furthermore, the dual inhibition strategy affected the expression of several mineralization-related enzymes while increasing expression of the smooth muscle cell marker Acta2. We conclude that PHOSPHO1 plays a critical role in VSMC mineralization and that "phosphatase inhibition" may be a useful therapeutic strategy to reduce MVC.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) exist in multiple dynamic states (e.g., ligand-bound, inactive, G protein-coupled) that influence G protein activation and ultimately response generation. In quantitative models of GPCR signaling that incorporate these varied states, parameter values are often uncharacterized or varied over large ranges, making identification of important parameters and signaling outcomes difficult to intuit. Here we identify the ligand- and cell-specific parameters that are important determinants of cell-response behavior in a dynamic model of GPCR signaling using parameter variation and sensitivity analysis. The character of response (i.e., positive/neutral/inverse agonism) is, not surprisingly, significantly influenced by a ligand's ability to bias the receptor into an active conformation. We also find that several cell-specific parameters, including the ratio of active to inactive receptor species, the rate constant for G protein activation, and expression levels of receptors and G proteins also dramatically influence agonism. Expressing either receptor or G protein in numbers several fold above or below endogenous levels may result in system behavior inconsistent with that measured in endogenous systems. Finally, small variations in cell-specific parameters identified by sensitivity analysis as significant determinants of response behavior are found to change ligand-induced responses from positive to negative, a phenomenon termed protean agonism. Our findings offer an explanation for protean agonism reported in beta2--adrenergic and alpha2A-adrenergic receptor systems.},

abstract = {Artificial proteins that bind key metabolites with high affinity and specificity hold great promise as new tools in synthetic biology, but little has been done to create such molecules and examine their effects on living cells. Experiments of this kind have the potential to expand our understanding of cellular systems, as certain phenotypes may be physically realistic but not yet observed in nature. Here, we examine the physiology and morphology of a population of Escherichia coli as they respond to a genetically encoded, non-biological ATP-binding protein. Unlike natural ATP-dependent proteins, which transiently bind ATP during metabolic transformations, the synthetic protein DX depletes the concentration of intracellular ATP and ADP by a mechanism of protein-mediated ligand sequestration. The resulting ATP/ADP imbalance leads to an adaptive response in which a large population of bacilli cells transition to a filamentous state with dense lipid structures that segregate the cells into compartmentalized units. A wide range of biochemical and microscopy techniques extensively characterized these novel lipid structures, which we have termed endoliposomes. We show that endoliposomes adopt well-defined box-like structures that span the full width of the cell but exclude the synthetic protein DX. We further show that prolonged DX exposure causes a large fraction of the population to enter a viable-but-non-culturable state that is not easily reversed. Both phenotypes correlate with strong intracellular changes in ATP and ADP concentration. We suggest that artificial proteins, such as DX, could be used to control and regulate specific targets in metabolic pathways.},

abstract = {To investigate the role of adenosine formed extracellularly in vascular homeostasis, mice with a targeted deletion of the cd73/ecto-5'-nucleotidase were generated. Southern blot, RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis confirmed the constitutive knockout. In vivo analysis of hemodynamic parameters revealed no significant differences in systolic blood pressure, ejection fraction, or cardiac output between strains. However, basal coronary flow measured in the isolated perfused heart was significantly lower (-14\%; P<0.05) in the mutant. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong CD73 expression on the endothelium of conduit vessels in wild-type (WT) mice. Time to carotid artery occlusion after ferric chloride (FeCl3) was significantly reduced by 20\% in cd73-/- mice (P<0.05). Bleeding time after tail tip resection tended to be shorter in cd73-/- mice (-35\%). In vivo platelet cAMP levels were 0.96+/-0.46 in WT versus 0.68+/-0.27 pmol/106 cells in cd73-/- mice (P<0.05). Under in vitro conditions, platelet aggregation in response to ADP (0.05 to 10 micromol/L) was undistinguishable between the two strains. In the cremaster model of ischemia-reperfusion, the increase in leukocyte attachment to endothelium was significantly higher in cd73-/- compared with WT littermates (WT 98\% versus cd73-/- 245\%; P<0.005). The constitutive adhesion of monocytes in ex vivo-perfused carotid arteries of WT mice was negligible but significantly increased in arteries of cd73-/- mice (P<0.05). Thus, our data provide the first evidence that adenosine, extracellularly formed by CD73, can modulate coronary vascular tone, inhibit platelet activation, and play an important role in leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium in vivo.},

Partial manifestations of the PXE phenotype have also been described in presumed carriers in PXE families. Linkage of both dominant and recessive forms of PXE to a 5-cM domain on chromosome 16p13.1 has been reported (refs 8,9). We have refined this locus to an 820-kb region containing 6 candidate genes.

PXE is caused by mutations in ABCC6, a gene encoding an ABC transporter predominantly expressed in liver and kidneys. The functional relationship between ABCC6 and elastic fiber calcification is unknown. We speculated that ABCC6 deficiency in PXE patients induces a persistent imbalance in circulating metabolite(s), which may impair the synthetic abilities of normal elastoblasts or specifically alter elastic fiber assembly. Therefore, we compared the deposition of elastic fiber proteins in cultures of fibroblasts derived from PXE and unaffected individuals. PXE fibroblasts cultured with normal human serum expressed and deposited increased amounts of proteins, but structurally normal elastic fibers. Interestingly, normal and PXE fibroblasts as well as normal smooth muscle cells deposited abnormal aggregates of elastic fibers when maintained in the presence of serum from PXE patients. The expression of tropoelastin and other elastic fiber-associated genes was not significantly modulated by the presence of PXE serum. These results indicated that certain metabolites present in PXE sera interfered with the normal assembly of elastic fibers in vitro and suggested that PXE is a primary metabolic disorder with secondary connective tissue manifestations.},

abstract = {Abnormal mineralization occurs in the context of several common conditions, including advanced age, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal failure, and certain genetic conditions. Metabolic, mechanical, infectious, and inflammatory injuries promote ectopic mineralization through overlapping yet distinct molecular mechanisms of initiation and progression. The ABCC6 protein is an ATP-dependent transporter primarily found in the plasma membrane of hepatocytes. ABCC6 exports unknown substrates from the liver presumably for systemic circulation. ABCC6 deficiency is the primary cause for chronic and acute forms of ectopic mineralization described in diseases such as pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), $\beta$-thalassemia, and generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) in humans and dystrophic cardiac calcification (DCC) in mice. These pathologies are characterized by mineralization of cardiovascular, ocular, and dermal tissues. PXE and to an extent GACI are caused by inactivating ABCC6 mutations, whereas the mineralization associated with $\beta$-thalassemia patients derives from a liver-specific change in ABCC6 expression. DCC is an acquired phenotype resulting from cardiovascular insults (ischemic injury or hyperlipidemia) and secondary to ABCC6 insufficiency. Abcc6-deficient mice develop ectopic calcifications similar to both the human PXE and mouse DCC phenotypes. The precise molecular and cellular mechanism linking deficient hepatic ABCC6 function to distal ectopic mineral deposition is not understood and has captured the attention of many research groups. Our previously published work along with that of others show that ABCC6 influences other modulators of calcification and that it plays a much greater physiological role than originally thought.},

abstract = {Most diseases are the consequence of the breakdown of cellular processes, but the relationships among genetic/epigenetic defects, the molecular interaction networks underlying them, and the disease phenotypes remain poorly understood. To gain insights into such relationships, here we constructed a bipartite human disease association network in which nodes are diseases and two diseases are linked if mutated enzymes associated with them catalyze adjacent metabolic reactions. We find that connected disease pairs display higher correlated reaction flux rate, corresponding enzyme-encoding gene coexpression, and higher comorbidity than those that have no metabolic link between them. Furthermore, the more connected a disease is to other diseases, the higher is its prevalence and associated mortality rate. The network topology-based approach also helps to uncover potential mechanisms that contribute to their shared pathophysiology. Thus, the structure and modeled function of the human metabolic network can provide insights into disease comorbidity, with potentially important consequences for disease diagnosis and prevention.},

abstract = {Osteopontin is an arginine-glycine-aspartate containing acidic glycoprotein postulated to mediate adhesion, migration, and biomineralization in diverse tissues. The mechanisms explaining this multifunctionality are not well understood, although it is known that one osteopontin receptor is the alpha v beta 3 integrin. In this work, we studied human smooth muscle cells varying in alpha v beta 3 levels to identify additional osteopontin receptors. We report that, in addition to alpha v beta 3, both alpha v beta 5 and alpha v beta 1 are osteopontin receptors. Moreover, the presence or absence of alpha v beta 3 on the cell surface altered the adhesive and migratory responses of smooth muscle cells to osteopontin. Adhesion of alpha v beta 3-deficient cell populations to osteopontin was only half that of cells containing alpha v beta 3, and migration toward an osteopontin gradient in the Boyden chamber was dependent on cell surface alpha v beta 3. Although alpha v beta 3-deficient smooth muscle cells were unable to migrate to osteopontin, they did migrate significantly in response to vitronectin and fibronectin. These findings represent the first description of alpha v beta 5 and alpha v beta 1 as osteopontin receptors and suggest that, while adhesion to osteopontin is supported by integrins containing beta 1, beta 3, and beta 5, migration in response to osteopontin appears to depend on alpha v beta 3. Thus, interaction with distinct receptors is one mechanism by which osteopontin may initiate multiple functions.},

abstract = {Large-scale screening for known polymorphisms will require techniques with few steps and the ability to automate each of these steps. In this regard, the 5' nuclease, or TaqMan, PCR assay is especially attractive. A fluorogenic probe, consisting of an oligonucleotide labeled with both a fluorescent reporter dye and a quencher dye, is included in a typical PCR. Amplification of the probe-specific product causes cleavage of the probe, generating an increase in reporter fluorescence. By using different reporter dyes, cleavage of allele-specific probes can be detected in a single PCR. The 5' nuclease assay has been successfully used to discriminate alleles that differ by a single base substitution. Guidelines have been developed so that an assay for any single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can be quickly designed and implemented. All assays are performed using a single reaction buffer and single thermocycling protocol. Furthermore, a standard method of analysis has been developed that enables automated genotype determination. Applications of this assay have included typing a number of polymorphisms in human drug metabolism genes.},

abstract = {Pyrophosphate (PPi) is a known inhibitor of hydroxyapatite formation and has been shown to inhibit medial vascular calcification in vitamin D-toxic rats. It was demonstrated recently that endogenous production of PPi prevents calcification of rat aorta that are cultured in high concentrations of calcium and phosphate. For determining whether PPi metabolism is altered in hemodialysis patients, plasma levels and dialytic clearance of PPi were measured in stable hemodialysis patients. Predialysis plasma [PPi] was 2.26 +/- 0.19 microM in 38 clinically stable hemodialysis patients compared with 3.26 +/- 0.17 in 36 normal subjects (P < 0.01). Approximately 30\% of plasma PPi was protein bound, and this was not altered in dialysis patients. There was a weak inverse correlation with age in normal individuals but not in dialysis patients. Plasma [PPi] in dialysis patients was correlated with plasma [PO4(3-)] (r = 0.56) but not with [Ca2+], parathyroid hormone, or the dose of dialysis, and levels did not vary between interdialytic periods of 2 and 3 d. Plasma [PPi] decreased 32 +/- 5\% after standard hemodialysis in 17 patients. In vitro clearance of PPi by a 2.1-m2 cellulose acetate dialyzer was 36\%, and the mean PPi removal in five patients was 43 +/- 5 micromol, consistent with a similar in vivo clearance. Cleared PPi was greater than the plasma pool but less than the estimated extracellular fluid pool. Erythrocyte PPi content decreased 24 +/- 4\%, indicating that intracellular PPi is removed as well. It is concluded that plasma [PPi] is reduced in hemodialysis patients and that PPi is cleared by dialysis. Plasma levels in some patients were below those that have previously been shown to prevent calcification of vessels in culture, suggesting that altered PPi metabolism could contribute to vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients.},

We now describe the third familial case of ACDC, including radiological and histopathological details of the arterial calcifications. The medial lesions involve the entire circumference of the elastic lamina, in contrast to the intimal plaque-like disease of atherosclerosis. The demonstration of broken and fragmented elastic fibers leading to generalized vascular calcification suggests an analogy to pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), which exhibits similar histopathology. Classical PXE is caused by deficiency of ABCC6, a C type ABC transporter whose ligand is unknown. Other C type ABC proteins transport nucleotides, so the newly described role of adenosine in inhibiting vascular calcification, along with the similarity of ACDC and PXE with respect to vascular pathology, suggests that adenosine may be the ligand for ABCC6.},

abstract = {The purpose of the investigation was to develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model for the characterization of the cardiovascular effects of the adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) in individual normotensive rats. After the i.v. administration of 200 micrograms/kg (0.60 mumol/kg) of CPA, the time course of heart rate and arterial blood pressure was monitored in conjunction with serial blood sampling. Potential interference of the concentration-cardiovascular effect relationship by the development of acute tolerance or the formation of (inter)active metabolites was investigated by infusion of CPA with different rates and by determination of blood concentrations both by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioreceptor assay. In the individual rats the concentration-hemodynamic effect relationships were satisfactorily modeled according to the sigmoidal Emax pharmacodynamic model. For the negative chronotropic effect, the pharmacodynamic parameters proved to be independent of the infusion rate, indicating the absence of development of acute tolerance during the experiment. Potency (EC50) and intrinsic efficacy (Emax) were 2.7 +/- 0.5 ng/ml and -209 +/- 10 bpm, respectively (mean +/- S.E., n = 17). The concentrations of CPA as determined by the radioreceptor assay were identical to those determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, thereby excluding the formation of (inter)active metabolites. It is concluded that on the basis of this integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model, with the negative chronotropic effect as a pharmacodynamic endpoint, estimates of the potency and the intrinsic efficacy of adenosine A1 receptor agonists in vivo can be obtained after the administration of a single dose.},

abstract = {Two well-recognized patterns of calcification occur in large- and medium-sized arteries, intimal calcification associated with atherosclerosis and medial calcification described by M\"{o}nckeberg. Calcification limited to the internal elastic lamina is a third pattern of calcification not previously reported in coronary arteries. Here we describe 19 cases of coronary artery internal elastic lamina calcification. We serially sectioned and examined the coronary arteries of 66 patients with advanced AIDS and 27 HIV- controls with other chronic illnesses. We observed calcification of the internal elastic lamina in 10 HIV+ patients and 9 controls. HIV- patients with internal elastic lamina calcification were significantly older than HIV- patients without it (P=0.008) and HIV+ patients with it (P=0.006). Occasionally, calcification encroached on adjacent intimal or medial tissue with mild fibrosis. There was frequent disruption of the internal elastic lamina but no evidence of inflammation. Calcification was the dominant histologic feature in all cases. Von Kossa, Alizarin red, and trichrome/elastic stains confirmed these findings. Patients with internal elastic lamina calcification often had extensive medical histories but did not suffer from chronic renal failure or other conditions known to cause calcium dysregulation. We describe coronary internal elastic lamina calcification in HIV+ patients and older HIV- adults. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. It could lead to arterial stiffening and increased pulse pressure and could be mistaken for intimal calcification on coronary imaging. Internal elastic lamina calcification may result from premature aging due to HIV disease and chronic illness or from metabolic disorders in HIV+ patients.},

The availability of knockout mice deficient in each of the murine alkaline phosphatase isozymes has also given deep insights into their in vivo role. This has been particularly true for probing the biological role of bone alkaline phosphatase during skeletal mineralization. Due to space constraints this mini-review focuses exclusively on structural and functional features of mammalian alkaline phosphatases as identified by crystallography and probed by site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis. An emphasis is also placed on the substrate specificity of alkaline phosphatases, their catalytic properties as phosphohydrolases as well as phosphodiesterases and their structural and functional relatedness to a large superfamily of enzymes that includes nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase.},

abstract = {Major depression is a debilitating and recurrent disorder with a substantial lifetime risk and a high social cost. Depressed patients generally display co-morbid symptoms, and depression frequently accompanies other serious disorders. Currently available drugs display limited efficacy and a pronounced delay to onset of action, and all provoke distressing side effects. Cloning of the human genome has fuelled expectations that symptomatic treatment may soon become more rapid and effective, and that depressive states may ultimately be "prevented" or "cured". In pursuing these objectives, in particular for genome-derived, non-monoaminergic targets, "specificity" of drug actions is often emphasized. That is, priority is afforded to agents that interact exclusively with a single site hypothesized as critically involved in the pathogenesis and/or control of depression. Certain highly selective drugs may prove effective, and they remain indispensable in the experimental (and clinical) evaluation of the significance of novel mechanisms. However, by analogy to other multifactorial disorders, "multi-target" agents may be better adapted to the improved treatment of depressive states. Support for this contention is garnered from a broad palette of observations, ranging from mechanisms of action of adjunctive drug combinations and electroconvulsive therapy to "network theory" analysis of the etiology and management of depressive states. The review also outlines opportunities to be exploited, and challenges to be addressed, in the discovery and characterization of drugs recognizing multiple targets. Finally, a diversity of multi-target strategies is proposed for the more efficacious and rapid control of core and co-morbid symptoms of depression, together with improved tolerance relative to currently available agents.},

Many approaches based on gene therapy aim to repair the defective gene or to insert genes with compensatory function. Here, we propose an alternative, network-based strategy that aims to restore biological function by forcing the cell to either bypass the functions affected by the defective gene, or to compensate for the lost function. Focusing on the metabolism of single-cell organisms, we computationally study mutants that lack an essential enzyme, and thus are unable to grow or have a significantly reduced growth rate. We show that several of these mutants can be turned into viable organisms through additional gene deletions that restore their growth rate. In a rather counterintuitive fashion, this is achieved via additional damage to the metabolic network. Using flux balance-based approaches, we identify a number of synthetically viable gene pairs, in which the removal of one enzyme-encoding gene results in a non-viable phenotype, while the deletion of a second enzyme-encoding gene rescues the organism. The systematic network-based identification of compensatory rescue effects may open new avenues for genetic interventions.},

abstract = {ENPP1 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1) is an established regulator of tissue mineralization. Previous studies demonstrated that ENPP1 is expressed in differentiated osteoblasts and that ENPP1 influences matrix mineralization by increasing extracellular levels of inorganic pyrophosphate. ENPP1 is also expressed in osteoblastic precursor cells when stimulated with FGF2, but the role of ENPP1 in preosteoblastic and other precursor cells is unknown. Here we investigate the function of ENPP1 in preosteoblasts. We find that ENPP1 expression is critical for osteoblastic differentiation and that this effect is not mediated by changes in extracellular concentration levels of phosphate or pyrophosphate or ENPP1 catalytic activity. MC3T3E1(C4) preosteoblastic cells, in which ENPP1 expression was suppressed by ENPP1-specific shRNA, and calvarial cells isolated from Enpp1 knock-out mice show defective osteoblastic differentiation upon stimulation with ascorbate, as indicated by a lack of cellular morphological change, a lack of osteoblast marker gene expression, and an inability to mineralize matrix. Additionally, MC3T3E1(C4) cells, in which wild type or catalytic inactive ENPP1 expression was increased, exhibited an increased tendency to differentiate, as evidenced by increased osteoblast marker gene expression and increased mineralization. Notably, treatment of cells with inorganic phosphate or pyrophosphate inhibited, as opposed to enhanced, expression of multiple genes that are expressed in association with osteoblast differentiation, matrix deposition, and mineralization. Our results indicate that ENPP1 plays multiple and distinct roles in the development of mineralized tissues and that the influence of ENPP1 on osteoblast differentiation and gene expression may include a mechanism that is independent of its catalytic activity.},

Bone and cartilage tissue as well as osteoblast- and chondrocyte-like cells are present in calcified arteries. As in bone formation, apoptosis and matrix vesicles play an important role in the initiation of vascular calcification. Recent evidence indicates that nanocrystals initially formed in the vessel wall may actively be involved in the progression of the calcification process. This review focuses on the cellular and structural similarities between bone formation and vascular calcification and discusses the initial events in this pathological mineralization process.},

abstract = {Spontaneous pathologic arterial calcifications in childhood can occur in generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) or in pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). GACI is associated with biallelic mutations in ENPP1 in the majority of cases, whereas mutations in ABCC6 are known to cause PXE. However, the genetic basis in subsets of both disease phenotypes remains elusive. We hypothesized that GACI and PXE are in a closely related spectrum of disease. We used a standardized questionnaire to retrospectively evaluate the phenotype of 92 probands with a clinical history of GACI. We obtained the ENPP1 genotype by conventional sequencing. In those patients with less than two disease-causing ENPP1 mutations, we sequenced ABCC6. We observed that three GACI patients who carried biallelic ENPP1 mutations developed typical signs of PXE between 5 and 8 years of age; these signs included angioid streaks and pseudoxanthomatous skin lesions. In 28 patients, no disease-causing ENPP1 mutation was found. In 14 of these patients, we detected pathogenic ABCC6 mutations (biallelic mutations in eight patients, monoallelic mutations in six patients). Thus, ABCC6 mutations account for a significant subset of GACI patients, and ENPP1 mutations can also be associated with PXE lesions in school-aged children. Based on the considerable overlap of genotype and phenotype of GACI and PXE, both entities appear to reflect two ends of a clinical spectrum of ectopic calcification and other organ pathologies, rather than two distinct disorders. ABCC6 and ENPP1 mutations might lead to alterations of the same physiological pathways in tissues beyond the artery.},

Insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to arterial calcification has come from genetic studies on four rare monogenic disorders. The disease-causing molecular defects in generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), calcification of joints and arteries (CALJA), and familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC) have been identified within recent years. Based on the similarities of GACI, PXE, CALJA, and IBGC, it can be speculated that the underlying disease genes-ENPP1, ABCC6, NT5E, and SLC20A2, respectively-drive a cohesive molecular pathophysiology system modulated by ATP metabolism, inorganic pyrophosphate, adenosine, and inorganic phosphate generation and functional activities.},

abstract = {Craniometaphyseal dysplasia (CMD) is a bone dysplasia characterized by overgrowth and sclerosis of the craniofacial bones and abnormal modeling of the metaphyses of the tubular bones. Hyperostosis and sclerosis of the skull may lead to cranial nerve compressions resulting in hearing loss and facial palsy. An autosomal dominant form of the disorder (MIM 123000) was linked to chromosome 5p15.2-p14.1 (ref. 3) within a region harboring the human homolog (ANKH) of the mouse progressive ankylosis (ank) gene. The ANK protein spans the outer cell membrane and shuttles inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a major inhibitor of physiologic and pathologic calcification, bone mineralization and bone resorption. Here we carry out mutation analysis of ANKH, revealing six different mutations in eight of nine families. The mutations predict single amino acid substitutions, deletions or insertions. Using a helix prediction program, we propose for the ANK molecule 12 membrane-spanning helices with an alternate inside/out orientation and a central channel permitting the passage of PPi. The mutations occur at highly conserved amino acid residues presumed to be located in the cytosolic portion of the protein. Our results link the PPi channel ANK with bone formation and remodeling.},

abstract = {Vascular calcification is common in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and is associated with poorer outcomes. Although the pathophysiology is not completely understood, it is clear that it is a multifactorial process involving altered mineral metabolism, as well as changes in systemic and local factors that can promote or inhibit vascular calcification, and all of these are potential therapeutic targets. Current therapy is closely linked to strategies for preventing disordered bone and mineral metabolism in advanced kidney disease and involves lowering the circulating levels of both phosphate and calcium. The efficacy of compounds that specifically target calcification, such as bisphosphonates and thiosulfate, has been shown in animals but only in small numbers of humans, and safety remains an issue. Additional therapies, such as pyrophosphate, vitamin K, and lowering of pH, are supported by animal studies, but are yet to be investigated clinically. As the mineral composition of vascular calcifications is the same as in bone, potential effects on bone must be addressed with any therapy for vascular calcification.},

abstract = {Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine (OPLL) is a common form of human myelopathy caused by a compression of the spinal cord by ectopic ossification of spinal ligaments. To elucidate the genetic basis for OPLL, we have been studying the ttw (tiptoe walking; previously designated twy) mouse, a naturally occurring mutant which exhibits ossification of the spinal ligaments very similar to human OPLL (refs 3,4). Using a positional candidate-gene approach, we determined the ttw phenotype is caused by a nonsense mutation (glycine 568 to stop) in the Npps gene which encodes nucleotide pyrophosphatase. This enzyme regulates soft-tissue calcification and bone mineralization by producing inorganic pyrophosphate, a major inhibitor of calcification. The accelerated bone formation characteristic of ttw mice is likely to result from dysfunction of NPPS caused by predicted truncation of the gene product, resulting in the loss of more than one-third of the native protein. Our results may lead to novel insights into the mechanism of ectopic ossification and the aetiology of human OPLL.},

Indeed, traditional methods such as the Western blot or ELISA remain a standard method for determining the phosphorylation status of endogenous STAT proteins. Here we present data for the rapid detection of endogenous receptor-mediated phosphorylation of multiple STAT proteins using the bead-based AlphaScreen SureFire technology. With three different cell lines (human acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells, human erythroleukemic TF-1 cells, and human T lymphocytic Jurkat cells), we have optimized a rapid and homogeneous methodology for monitoring endogenous, receptor-mediated signaling via STAT 1, STAT 3, or STAT 5 phosphorylation, in response to several agonists. These assays, which can be tailored for both standard research applications or high-throughput drug screening applications, afford quantitative data for receptor-mediated signaling mechanisms in an endogenous, cellular environment.},

abstract = {Aims The association between alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and mortality was reported in several subgroups of patients. But, the role of ALP in overall coronary artery disease (CAD) patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic value of the ALP level in patients with CAD who underwent PCI with drug-eluting stent (DES). Methods and results We prospectively included CAD patients who underwent PCI with DES. After exclusion of patients with liver disease and cancer, 1636 patients were selected for the analysis of clinical outcomes (median duration of follow-up; 762 days, inter-quartile range; 494-1068 days), and were classified into tertiles by baseline measurements of ALP (<63, 63-78, and >78 IU/L). After adjustment of potential confounders including angiographic data, the independent and dose-dependent association was observed between tertile of ALP and the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause mortality (P for trend < 0.0001). Specifically, compared with the lowest ALP tertile, the adjusted HR of all-cause mortality in the highest tertile was 4.21 (95\% confidence interval 2.03-8.71). In subgroup of patients with stable or unstable angina, a similar association was noted (P for trend < 0.0001). In terms of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis, the adjusted HRs in the highest ALP tertile were 3.92 (1.37-11.20), 1.98 (0.91-4.29), and 2.73 (1.33-5.61), respectively, compared with the lowest tertile. Furthermore, evaluation of both ALP and C-reactive protein provided better predictive value than either alone. Interesting result suggesting the mechanism was that ALP was significantly associated with the presence of angiographic coronary calcification (P for trend = 0.046). Conclusion Our study demonstrated that the higher serum ALP level is an independent predictor of mortality, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis in CAD patients after PCI with DES.},

@article{Roberts2005,
abstract = {PHOSPHO1, a phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine phosphatase, is upregulated in mineralising cells and is thought to be involved in the generation of inorganic phosphate for bone mineralisation. PHOSPHO2 is a putative phosphatase sharing 42\% sequence identity with PHOSPHO1. Both proteins contain three catalytic motifs, conserved within the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily. Mutation of Asp32 and Asp203, key residues within two motifs, abolish PHOSPHO1 activity and confirm it as a member of this superfamily. We also show that Asp43 and Asp123, residues that line the substrate-binding site in our PHOSPHO1 model, are important for substrate hydrolysis. Further comparative modelling reveals that the active sites of PHOSPHO1 and PHOSPHO2 are very similar, but surprisingly, recombinant PHOSPHO2 hydrolyses phosphoethanolamine and phosphocholine relatively poorly. Instead, PHOSPHO2 shows high specific activity toward pyridoxal-5-phosphate (V(max) of 633 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) and K(m) of 45.5 microM). Models of PHOSPHO2 and PHOSPHO1 suggest subtle differences in the charge distributions around the putative substrate entry site and in the location of potential H-bond donors.},

abstract = {In this study, we have identified the E-NTPDase family members and ecto-5'-nucleotidase/CD73 in rat heart left ventricle. Moreover, we characterize the biochemical properties and enzyme activities from synaptosomes of the nerve terminal endings of heart left ventricle. We observe divalent cation-dependent enzymes that presented optimum pH of 8.0 for ATP and ADP hydrolysis, and 9.5 for AMP hydrolysis. The apparent K(M) values are 40 microM, 90 microM and 39 microM and apparent V(max) values are 537, 219 and 111 nmol Pi released/min/mg of protein for ATP, ADP and AMP hydrolysis, respectively. Ouabain, orthovanadate, NEM, lanthanum and levamisole do not affect ATP and ADP hydrolysis in rat cardiac synaptosomes. Oligomycin (2 microg/mL) and sodium azide (0.1 mM), both mitochondrial ATPase inhibitors, inhibit only the ATP hydrolysis. High concentrations of sodium azide and gadolinium chloride show an inhibition on both, ATP and ADP hydrolysis. Suramin inhibit more strongly ATP hydrolysis than ADP hydrolysis whereas Evans blue almost abolish both hydrolysis. AMP hydrolysis is not affected by levamisole and tetramisole, whereas 0.1 mM ammonium molybdate practically abolish the ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity. RT-PCR analysis from left ventricle tissue demonstrate different levels of expression of Entpd1 (Cd39), Entpd2 (Cd39L1), Entpd3 (Cd39L3), Entpd5 (Cd39L4) Entpd6, (Cd39L2) and 5'-NT/CD73. By quantitative real-time PCR we identify the Entpd2 as the enzyme with the highest expression in rat left ventricle. Our results contribute to the understanding about the control of the extracellular nucleotide levels in and cardiac system.},

abstract = {Artery calcification reflects an admixture of factors such as ectopic osteochondral differentiation with primary host pathological conditions. We review how genetic factors, as identified by human genome-wide association studies, and incomplete correlations with various mouse studies, including knockout and strain analyses, fit into "pieces of the puzzle" in intimal calcification in human atherosclerosis, and artery tunica media calcification in aging, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. We also describe in sharp contrast how ENPP1, CD73, and ABCC6 serve as "cogs in a wheel" of arterial calcification. Specifically, each is a minor component in the function of a much larger network of factors that exert balanced effects to promote and suppress arterial calcification. For the network to normally suppress spontaneous arterial calcification, the "cogs" ENPP1, CD73, and ABCC6 must be present and in working order. Monogenic ENPP1, CD73, and ABCC6 deficiencies each drive a molecular pathophysiology of closely related but phenotypically different diseases (generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) and arterial calcification caused by CD73 deficiency (ACDC)), in which premature onset arterial calcification is a prominent but not the sole feature.},

This approach focuses on creating quantitative, testable models of complex biological systems that take into consideration the time dimension. They are usually expressed as mathematical models, and because of their time dependence and complexity, they usually require computer simulation to determine predicted outcomes. Here, we provide an example of such a model used to analyze self-organization and mineralization of vascular stem cells, using partial differential equations capable of accurately predicting experimental outcomes. Such systems-based models are useful in many aspects of cardiovascular medicine.},

abstract = {Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is actively released in the extracellular environment in response to tissue damage and cellular stress. Through the activation of P2X and P2Y receptors, extracellular ATP enhances tissue repair, promotes the recruitment of immune phagocytes and dendritic cells, and acts as a co-activator of NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes. The conversion of extracellular ATP to adenosine, in contrast, essentially through the enzymatic activity of the ecto-nucleotidases CD39 and CD73, acts as a negative-feedback mechanism to prevent excessive immune responses. Here we review the effects of extracellular ATP and adenosine on tumorigenesis. First, we summarize the functions of extracellular ATP and adenosine in the context of tumor immunity. Second, we present an overview of the immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic effects of extracellular adenosine. Third, we present experimental evidence that extracellular ATP and adenosine receptors are expressed by tumor cells and enhance tumor growth. Finally, we discuss recent studies, including our own work, which suggest that therapeutic approaches that promote ATP-mediated activation of inflammasomes, or inhibit the accumulation of tumor-derived extracellular adenosine, may constitute effective new means to induce anticancer activity.},

abstract = {CD731 is a GPI-anchored cell surface protein with ecto-5'-nucleotidase enzyme activity that plays a crucial role in adenosine production. While the roles of adenosine receptors (AR) on osteoblasts and osteoclasts have been unveiled to some extent, the roles of CD73 and CD73-generated adenosine in bone tissue are largely unknown. To address this issue, we first analyzed the bone phenotype of CD73-deficient (cd73(-/-)) mice. The mutant male mice showed osteopenia, with significant decreases of osteoblastic markers. Levels of osteoclastic markers were, however, comparable to those of wild-type mice. A series of in vitro studies revealed that CD73 deficiency resulted in impairment in osteoblast differentiation but not in the number of osteoblast progenitors. In addition, over expression of CD73 on MC3T3-E1 cells resulted in enhanced osteoblastic differentiation. Moreover, MC3T3-E1 cells expressed adenosine A(2A) receptors (A(2A)AR) and A(2B) receptors (A(2B)AR) and expression of these receptors increased with osteoblastic differentiation. Enhanced expression of osteocalcin (OC) and bone sialoprotein (BSP) observed in MC3T3-E1 cells over expressing CD73 were suppressed by treatment with an A(2B)AR antagonist but not with an A(2A) AR antagonist. Collectively, our results indicate that CD73 generated adenosine positively regulates osteoblast differentiation via A(2B)AR signaling.},

abstract = {Phosphate uptake was studied in confluent monolayers of an epithelial-cell line (JTC-12) derived from monkey kidney. Phosphate uptake consisted of a saturable, Na+-dependent, component, which accounted for about 80\% of the uptake, and a nonsaturable, Na+-independent, component. The saturable component was specifically dependent on the presence of extracellular Na+ and has an apparent Km value for phosphate of 0.12 mM at 137-mM-Na+, which is close to those reported in the brush-border membranes in mammalian kidneys. The presence of Na+ in the uptake solution decreased the Km for phosphate without affecting the Vmax. Phosphate uptake was inhibited by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and ouabain, suggesting that phosphate transport is an active, energy-dependent, process and is dependent on an Na+ gradient across cell membranes. With respect to the effect of external Na+ concentration, a sigmoid relation was seen between the initial velocity of phosphate uptake and Na+ concentrations, and Hill analysis gave a Hill coefficient of 1.8. In the pH range 6.6-7.4, phosphate uptake declined with increasing pH. Phosphate uptake was stimulated when cells were cultured in the presence of insulin, and was also affected by changes in phosphate concentrations in cultured medium. These results indicate that JTC-12 cells have an Na+-dependent phosphate-transport system with many of the features of phosphate transport in the proximal tubule.},

abstract = {Extracellular adenosine has been widely implicated in adaptive responses to hypoxia. The generation of extracellular adenosine involves phosphohydrolysis of adenine nucleotide intermediates, and is regulated by the terminal enzymatic step catalyzed by ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73). Guided by previous work indicating that hypoxia-induced vascular leakage is, at least in part, controlled by adenosine, we generated mice with a targeted disruption of the third coding exon of Cd73 to test the hypothesis that CD73-generated extracellular adenosine functions in an innate protective pathway for hypoxia-induced vascular leakage. Cd73(-/-) mice bred and gained weight normally, and appeared to have an intact immune system. However, vascular leakage was significantly increased in multiple organs, and after subjection to normobaric hypoxia (8\% O(2)), Cd73(-/-) mice manifested fulminant vascular leakage, particularly prevalent in the lung. Histological examination of lungs from hypoxic Cd73(-/-) mice revealed perivascular interstitial edema associated with inflammatory infiltrates surrounding larger pulmonary vessels. Vascular leakage secondary to hypoxia was reversed in part by adenosine receptor agonists or reconstitution with soluble 5'-nucleotidase. Together, our studies identify CD73 as a critical mediator of vascular leakage in vivo.},

abstract = {Cordycepin is a bioactive constituent of Cordyceps sinensis that has been shown to regulate homeostatic function. As an adenosine analogue, it is possible cordycepin goes through a similar metabolic pathway to that of adenosine. To investigate this hypothesis, a sensitive liquid chromatography with photodiode-array detector (HPLC-PDA) coupled to a microdialysis sampling system was developed to monitor cordycepin and adenosine in rat blood and liver. Other endogenous nucleosides were simultaneously measured to further understand the downstream metabolic pathway. The experiments were divided into six parallel groups for drug administration: (1) normal saline vehicle, (2) adenosine, (3) cordycepin, (4) normal saline + erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA; a potent adenosine deaminase inhibitor), (5) adenosine + EHNA, and (6) cordycepin + EHNA. The pharmacokinetic results suggest that the levels of both adenosine and cordycepin decreased rapidly in blood around 30 min after drug administration. When adenosine was given, the concentrations of adenosine metabolites, hypoxanthinosine and hypoxanthine, increased in rat blood. This phenomenon was inhibited by EHNA pretreatment. An unidentified peak was observed in the blood and liver samples after cordycepin administration. The decline of this unidentified peak paralleled the decreased of the concentration of cordycepin, and it was not observed in the presence of the adenosine deaminase inhibitor. It is concluded that adenosine and cordycepin had short elimination half-lives and high rates of clearance and their biotransformation was suppressed by EHNA.},

abstract = {In this study, we analyzed the antilipolytic effects of six N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine analogs in rats and developed a mechanistic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model to quantify and predict the tissue-selective action of adenosine A(1) receptor agonists in vivo. Freely moving rats received an i.v. infusion of vehicle or compound over 15 min. Arterial blood samples were taken at regular time intervals for the determination of concentrations of drugs using HPLC analysis and of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs). All N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine analogs that were investigated produced a significant decrease in the NEFA plasma concentration after i.v. infusion. The pharmacokinetic behavior of each ligand was described by a standard two-compartment model. The pharmacokinetic parameter estimates then were used to simultaneously fit the individual (n = 6-8) time-NEFA concentration profiles for each agonist to a physiological indirect response model in combination with the Hill equation to obtain estimates of the NEFA elimination rate constant (k(e)) and upper asymptote (fractional inhibition), midpoint location, and midpoint slope parameter (alpha, pEC(50), and n(H), respectively) of the concentration-effect relationship. Subsequently, the data were analyzed with the operational model of agonism to obtain estimates of in vivo affinity and efficacy. It was estimated that the in vivo density and/or coupling of adenosine A(1) receptors mediating antilipolytic effects is approximately 38 times higher compared with the receptors mediating bradycardia. The model predicts that it is possible to design ligands that produce significant inhibition of lipolysis and are completely devoid of cardiovascular effects in vivo.},

abstract = {The aortic heart valve undergoes geometric and mechanical changes over time. The cusps of a normal, healthy valve thicken and become less extensible over time. In the disease calcific aortic stenosis (CAS), calcified nodules progressively stiffen the cusps. The local mechanical changes in the cusps, due to either normal aging or pathological processes, affect overall function of the valve. In this paper, we propose a computational model for the aging aortic valve that connects local changes to overall valve function. We extend a previous model for the healthy valve to describe aging. To model normal/uncomplicated aging, leaflet thickness and extensibility are varied versus age according to experimental data. To model calcification, initial sites are defined and a simple growth law is assumed. The nodules then grow over time, so that the area of calcification increases from one model to the next model representing greater age. Overall valve function is recorded for each individual model to yield a single simulation of valve function over time. This simulation is the first theoretical tool to describe the temporal behavior of aortic valve calcification. The ability to better understand and predict disease progression will aid in design and timing of patient treatments for CAS.},

abstract = {There has been considerable progress in the systemic treatment of cancer because of the rapid development and clinical application of molecular targeted agents. Although patients with a particular type and stage of cancer are often treated as a single group, more-specific therapy is being considered, as subsets of these patients who are more likely to benefit from treatment with particular agents are being identified. We previously introduced the concept of 'oncogene addiction' to explain how some cancers that contain multiple genetic, epigenetic, and chromosomal abnormalities are dependent on or 'addicted' to one or a few genes for both maintenance of the malignant phenotype and cell survival. Thus, reversal of only one or a few of these abnormalities can inhibit cancer cell growth and in some cases translate to improved survival rates. This review summarizes current experimental and clinical evidence for the concept of oncogene addiction and describes molecular mechanisms that may explain this phenomenon. In addition, we discuss how high-throughput screening methods, including gene-expression profiling and proteomics, and emerging methods for analyzing complex cellular networks can be used to identify the state of oncogene addiction, i.e. the 'Achilles' heel,' in specific cancers. Finally, we discuss the use of molecular targeted agents in combination with other anticancer agents as a strategy to optimize therapy and prevent disease recurrence.},

This method takes advantage of specific phosphatases that can be added into glycosyltransferase reactions to quantitatively release inorganic phosphate from the leaving groups of glycosyltransferase reactions. The released phosphate group is then detected using colorimetric malachite-based reagents. Because the amount of phosphate released is directly proportional to the sugar molecule transferred in a glycosyltransferase reaction, this method can be used to obtain accurate kinetic parameters of the glycosyltransferase. The assay can be performed in multiwell plates and quantitated by a plate reader, thus making it amenable to high-throughput screening. It has been successfully applied to all glycosyltransferases available to us, including glucosyltransferases, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, N-acetylgalactosyltransferases, galactosyltransferases, fucosyltransferases and sialyltransferases. As examples, we first assayed Clostridium difficile toxin B, a protein O-glucosyltransferase that specifically monoglucosylates and inactivates Rho family small GTPases; we then showed that human KTELC1, a homolog of Rumi from Drosophila, was able to hydrolyze UDP-Glc; and finally, we measured the kinetic parameters of human sialyltransferase ST6GAL1.},

abstract = {E-NTPDases are extracellular enzymes that hydrolyze nucleotides. The human E-NTPDase gene family currently consists of five reported members (CD39, CD39L1, CD39L2, CD39L3, and CD39L4). Both membrane-bound and secreted family members have been predicted by encoded transmembrane and leader peptide motifs. In this report, we demonstrate that the human CD39L2 gene is expressed predominantly in the heart. In situ hybridization results from heart indicate that the CD39L2 message is expressed in muscle and capillary endothelial cells. We also show that the CD39L2 gene encodes an extracellular E-NTPDase. Flow cytometric experiments show that transiently expressed CD39L2 is present on the surface of COS-7 cells. Transfected cells also produce recombinant glycosylated protein in the medium, and this process can be blocked by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of the mammalian secretory pathway. The enzymology of CD39L2 shows characteristic features of a typical E-NTPDase, but with a much higher degree of specificity for NDPs over NTPs as enzymatic substrates. The kinetics of the ADPase activity exhibit positive cooperativity. The predominance of CD39L2 expression in the heart supports a functional role in regulating platelet activation and recruitment in this organ.},

Additional influences of atherosclerosis, glucose regulation, chronic renal disease, salt, and changes in neurohormonal regulation are discussed. A review of the hemodynamic impact of arterial stiffness follows. A number of lifestyle changes and therapies that reduce arterial stiffness are presented, including weight loss, exercise, salt reduction, alcohol consumption, and neuroendocrine-directed therapies, such as those targeting the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, natriuretic peptides, insulin modulators, as well as novel therapies that target advanced glycation end products.},

@article{Chiu2010,
abstract = {Vascular calcification is one of the mechanisms mediating the higher mortality risk associated with the hyperphosphatemia of chronic kidney disease. Though common, and often severe in non-dialyzed proteinuric diabetics, there are no studies on the prognostic significance of coronary artery calcification in early stage type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Here we determine this significance in 225 proteinuric diabetic patients (mean age 57 years, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 52 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a median urine protein-creatinine ratio of 2.7). Coronary artery calcification, measured by electron beam computed tomography, was diagnosed in 86\% of the patients, the severity of which correlated with older age, male gender, and white ethnicity. However, no association was found between eGFR, serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, or 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Over an average follow-up of 39 months, 54 patients died. A graded relationship between the severity of calcification and all-cause mortality was consistently demonstrated on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients in the highest quartile of calcification score had a 2.5-fold higher risk for death. Our results show the severity of coronary artery calcification early in the course of chronic kidney disease is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Additional studies need to determine whether altering the natural history of coronary artery calcification in early chronic kidney disease prolongs survival.},
