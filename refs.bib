abstract = {Vascular calcification, long thought to result from passive degeneration, involves a complex, regulated process of biomineralization resembling osteogenesis. Evidence indicates that proteins controlling bone mineralization are also involved in the regulation of vascular calcification. Artery wall cells grown in culture are induced to become osteogenic by inflammatory and atherogenic stimuli. Furthermore, osteoclast-like cells are found in calcified atherosclerotic plaques, and active resorption of ectopic vascular calcification has been demonstrated. In general, soft tissue calcification arises in areas of chronic inflammation, possibly functioning as a barrier limiting the spread of the inflammatory stimulus. Atherosclerotic calcification may be one example of this process, in which oxidized lipids are the inflammatory stimulus. Calcification is widely used as a clinical indicator of atherosclerosis. It progresses nonlinearly with time, following a sigmoid-shaped curve. The relationship between calcification and clinical events likely relates to mechanical instability introduced by calcified plaque at its interface with softer, noncalcified plaque. In general, as calcification proceeds, interface surface area increases initially, but eventually decreases as plaques coalesce. This phenomenon may account for reports of less calcification in unstable plaque. Vascular calcification is exacerbated in certain clinical entities, including diabetes, menopause, and osteoporosis. Mechanisms linking them must be considered in clinical decisions. For example, treatments for osteoporosis may have unanticipated effects on vascular calcification; the converse also applies. Further understanding of processes governing vascular calcification may yield new therapeutic options for vascular disease.},

Calcification of the media is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The phenotypic and the molecular fingerprints of medial calcification in patients with diabetes and patients with chronic kidney disease are strikingly similar. While disturbances in divalent ion homeostasis have been proposed to play a role in calcification of the media in patients with chronic kidney disease, patients with diabetes have an apparently intact bone and mineral metabolism. Chronic kidney disease as well as diabetes are now recognized as pro-inflammatory states. This review will explore the pathobiology of medial vascular calcification, review the evidence for diabetes and chronic kidney disease as pro-inflammatory states, and discuss the role of inflammation as a mechanistic link that explains the similarities in phenotypic and molecular characteristics of medial calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease and patients with diabetes mellitus.},

In this study, bone morphogenetic protein-2a, a potent factor for osteoblastic differentiation, was found to be expressed in calcified human atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, cells cultured from the aortic wall formed calcified nodules similar to those found in bone cell cultures and expressed bone morphogenetic protein-2a with prolonged culture. The predominant cells in these nodules had immunocytochemical features characteristic of microvascular pericytes that are capable of osteoblastic differentiation. Pericyte-like cells were also found by immunohistochemistry in the intima of bovine and human aorta.

abstract = {Vascular calcification often occurs with advancing age, atherosclerosis, various metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease, or in rare genetic diseases, leading to serious clinical consequences. Such mineralization can occur at various sites (cardiac valves, arterial intima or media, capillaries), involve localized or diffuse widespread calcification, and result from numerous causes that provoke active inflammatory and osteogenic processes or disordered mineral homeostasis. Although valuable research has defined many key factors and cell types involved, surprising new insights continue to arise that deepen our understanding and suggest novel research directions or strategies for clinical intervention in calcific vasculopathies. One emerging area in vascular biology involves the RANKL/RANK/OPG system, molecules of the tumor necrosis factor-related family recently discovered to be critical regulators of immune and skeletal biology. Evidence is accumulating that such signals may be expressed, regulated, and function in vascular physiology and pathology in unique ways to promote endothelial cell survival, angiogenesis, monocyte or endothelial cell recruitment, and smooth muscle cell osteogenesis and calcification. Concerted research efforts are greatly needed to understand these potential roles, clarify whether RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand) promotes and osteoprotegerin (OPG) protects against vascular calcification, define how OPG genetic polymorphisms relate to cardiovascular disease, and learn whether elevated serum OPG levels reflect endothelial dysfunction in patients. Overall, the RANKL/RANK/OPG system may mediate important and complex links between the vascular, skeletal, and immune systems. Thus, these molecules may play a central role in regulating the development of vascular calcification coincident with declines in skeletal mineralization with age, osteoporosis, or disease.},

We show that the expression of CD39/ENTPD1 in concert with CD73/ecto-5'-nucleotidase distinguishes CD4(+)/CD25(+)/Foxp3(+) T reg cells from other T cells. These ectoenzymes generate pericellular adenosine from extracellular nucleotides. The coordinated expression of CD39/CD73 on T reg cells and the adenosine A2A receptor on activated T effector cells generates immunosuppressive loops, indicating roles in the inhibitory function of T reg cells. Consequently, T reg cells from Cd39-null mice show impaired suppressive properties in vitro and fail to block allograft rejection in vivo. We conclude that CD39 and CD73 are surface markers of T reg cells that impart a specific biochemical signature characterized by adenosine generation that has functional relevance for cellular immunoregulation.},

abstract = {Lansoprazole, a known H(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor, is currently used as a therapeutical option for the initial treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Recently, lansoprazole has been found to be an inhibitor of cytosolic PHOSPHO1 (a phosphatase which hydrolyses phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine), providing a possible therapeutical target to cure pathological mineralization. Since PHOSPHO1 is present inside matrix vesicles, we tested the effect of lansoprazole on matrix vesicles containing several key enzymes for the mineralization process including tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. We found that lansoprazole can inhibit in an uncompetitive manner tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. A K(i) value of 1.74 +/- 0.12 mM has been determined for the inhibition of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase by lansoprazole. Lansoprazole, currently used for treating gastroesophageal disease, by inhibiting PHOSPHO1 and tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase could prevent hydroxyapatite-deposition disease and could serve as an adjunct treatment for osteoarthritis.},

abstract = {The process of vascular calcification presents several features similar to osteogenesis in which fibronectin (FN) acts as a regulator of osteoblastic differentiation and the ERK signal pathway is involved. In order to find whether FN promotes the osteoblastic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through the ERK signal pathway, we investigated the effect of FN on the calcification of VSMCs by using an in vitro cell model. VSMCs cultured in plates with FN (0-20 microg/cm2) coating were induced to calcify by 10 mM sodium beta-glycerophosphate (beta-GP). FN exacerbated VSMC calcification in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as indicated by the number of calcifying nodules per slide and the amount of calcium in the deposition. Data from RT-PCR and immunoblotting assay revealed that FN also enhanced the expression of several phenotypic markers of osteoblasts, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin (OC), and Osf2/Cbfa1, a key transcription factor in osteoblastic differentiation. Furthermore, a specific inhibitor for ERK, PD98059 (10 microM), significantly suppressed the effect of FN on calcification and phenotypic marker expression. These findings seem to suggest that FN enhanced vascular calcification by promoting the osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs via ERK signal pathway.},

Majesky, and S. Schwartz. 1991. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 177:867-873). In this study, we sequenced the complete cDNA and conclusively identified one of these genes, 2B7, as rat osteopontin. Using immunochemistry and in situ hybridization, we found that medial smooth muscle cells (SMC) in uninjured arteries contained very low levels of osteopontin protein and mRNA. Injury to either the adult rat aorta or carotid artery using a balloon catheter initiated a qualitatively similar time-dependent increase in both osteopontin protein and mRNA in arterial SMC. Expression was transient and highly localized to neointimal SMC during the proliferative and migratory phases of arterial injury, suggesting a possible role for osteopontin in these processes. In vitro, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and angiotensin II (AII), all proteins implicated in the rat arterial injury response, elevated osteopontin expression in confluent vascular SMC. Finally, we found that osteopontin was a novel component of the human atherosclerotic plaque found most strikingly associated with calcified deposits. These data implicate osteopontin as a potentially important mediator of arterial neointima formation as well as dystrophic calcification that often accompanies this process.},

abstract = {Osteopontin is a secreted glycoprotein with a multidomain structure and functions characteristic of a matricellular protein. Osteopontin interacts with cell surface receptors via arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)- and non-RGD containing adhesive domains, in addition to binding to components of the structural extracellular matrix. While normally expressed in bone and kidney, osteopontin levels are elevated during wound healing and inflammation in most tissues studied to date. Since 1986, over one thousand studies have been published on osteopontin, including recent experiments in osteopontin-deficient mice. These studies reveal osteopontin as a cell adhesive, signaling, migratory, and survival stimulus for various mesenchymal, epithelial, and inflammatory cells, in addition to being a potent regulator of osseous and ectopic calcification. Based on these reports, a general picture of osteopontin as an important regulator of inflammation and biomineralization is emerging. A common denominator in osteopontin function in these situations is its ability to regulate the function of macrophage and macrophage-derived cells (i.e. osteoclasts). While we have learned much about osteopontin and the processes it appears to regulate over the past decade, many questions regarding this important multifunctional protein remain unanswered and provide important directions for future studies.},

In addition to the devastating effects of inappropriate biomineralization seen in cardiac valvulopathies, calciphylaxis, and idiopathic arterial calcification, vascular calcification is now recognized as a marker of atherosclerotic plaque burden as well as a major contributor to loss of arterial compliance and increased pulse pressure seen with age, diabetes, and renal insufficiency. In recent years, several mechanisms to explain vascular calcification have been identified including (1) loss of inhibition, (2) induction of bone formation, (3) circulating nucleational complexes, and (4) cell death. Alterations in calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) balance as seen in patients with ESRD promotes vascular calcification via multiple mechanisms and may explain the alarmingly high levels of cardiovascular disease deaths in these patients. Strategies to control Ca and P levels in patients with ESRD have met with early success in preventing progression of vascular calcification. Whether or not vascular calcification can be reversed is not yet known, but exciting new studies suggest that this may be possible in the future.},

abstract = {The action of adenosine on the myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle strips from guinea-pig ileum to high frequency electrical field stimulation (10 Hz) was investigated. Electrically induced contractions were reduced markedly by tetrodotoxin (0.2 microM) and atropine (1 microM), and partially by noradrenaline (3 microM) and morphine (3 microM). Adenosine, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the high frequency contractions over the range of 0.1-100 microM, the most potent being adenosine. The concentration-response curve for adenosine was significantly shifted to the left by dipyridamole (10 nM), while dipyridamole at higher concentrations (30 nM-10 microM), depressed the contraction markedly by itself. Dipyridamole decreased [3H]-adenosine uptake into strips of ileum in a concentration-dependent manner. There was a significant correlationship between the reduction of adenosine uptake and the inhibition of the contraction induced by dipyridamole (r = 0.970). In strips desensitized to adenosine or treated with adenosine deaminase, the inhibitory effect of dipyridamole was significantly reduced. The present investigation revealed that adenosine depressed responses of guinea-pig ileum to high frequency electrical stimulation and suggested that the inhibitory effect of dipyridamole may be closely associated with the behaviour of endogenous adenosine or related compounds.},

abstract = {Hypophosphatasia is a heritable form of rickets/osteomalacia with extremely variable clinical expression. Severe forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion; the mode of transmission of mild forms is uncertain. The biochemical hallmark of hypophosphatasia is deficient activity of the tissue-nonspecific isozyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). Previously, we demonstrated in one inbred infant that an identical missense mutation in both alleles of the gene encoding TNSALP caused lethal disease. We have now examined TNSALP cDNAs from four unrelated patients with the severe perinatal or infantile forms of hypophosphatasia. Each of the eight TNSALP alleles from these four individuals contains a different point mutation that causes an amino acid substitution. These base changes were not detected in at least 63 normal individuals and, thus, appear to be causes of hypophosphatasia in the four patients. (Two additional base substitutions, found in one allele from each of the four patients, are linked polymorphisms.) Twenty-three unrelated patients (of 50 screened), who reflect the entire clinical spectrum of hypophosphatasia, possess one of our of the above eight mutations. In two of these additional patients, mild forms of the disease are also inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Our findings indicate that hypophosphatasia can be caused by a number of different missense mutations and that the specific interactions of different TNSALP mutant alleles are probably important for determining clinical expression. Severe forms, perinatal and infantile disease, are largely the result of compound heterozygosity for different hypophosphatasia alleles. At least some cases of childhood and adult hypophosphatasia are inherited as autosomal recessive traits.},

abstract = {Osteoblasts mineralize bone matrix by promoting hydroxyapatite crystal formation and growth in the interior of membrane-limited matrix vesicles (MVs) and by propagating the crystals onto the collagenous extracellular matrix. Two osteoblast proteins, tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) and plasma cell membrane glycoprotein-1 (PC-1) are involved in this process. Mutations in the TNAP gene result in the inborn error of metabolism known as hypophosphatasia, characterized by poorly mineralized bones, spontaneous fractures, and elevated extracellular concentrations of inorganic pyrophosphate (PP(i)). PP(i) suppresses the formation and growth of hydroxyapatite crystals. PP(i) is produced by the nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase activity of a family of isozymes, with PC-1 being the only member present in MVs. Mice with spontaneous mutations in the PC-1 gene have hypermineralization abnormalities that include osteoarthritis and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine. Here, we show the respective correction of bone mineralization abnormalities in knockout mice null for both the TNAP (Akp2) and PC-1 (Enpp1) genes. Each allele of Akp2 and Enpp1 has a measurable influence on mineralization status in vivo. Ex vivo experiments using cultured double-knockout osteoblasts and their MVs demonstrate normalization of PP(i) content and mineral deposition. Our data provide evidence that TNAP and PC-1 are key regulators of the extracellular PP(i) concentrations required for controlled bone mineralization. Our results suggest that inhibiting PC-1 function may be a viable therapeutic strategy for hypophosphatasia. Conversely, interfering with TNAP activity may correct pathological hyperossification because of PP(i) insufficiency.},

abstract = {In trabecular bone fracture repair in vivo, osteogenesis occurs through endochondral ossification under hypoxic conditions, or through woven bone deposition in the vicinity of blood vessels. In vitro osteogenesis assays are routinely used to test osteoblastic responses to drugs, hormones, and biomaterials for bone and cartilage repair applications. These cell culture models recapitulate events that occur in woven bone synthesis, and are carried out using primary osteoblasts, osteoblast precursors such as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs), or various osteoblast cell lines. With time in culture, cell differentiation is typically assessed by examining levels of alkaline phosphatase activity (an early osteoblast marker) and by evaluating the assembly of a collagen (type I)-containing fibrillar extracellular matrix that mineralizes. In this review, we have made a comparative analysis of published osteogenic assays using calvarial cells, calvaria-derived cell lines, and bone marrow stromal cells. In all of these cell types, alkaline phosphatase activity shows similar progression over time using a variety of osteogenic and mineralizing media conditions; however, levels of alkaline phosphatase activity are not proportional to observed mineralization levels.},

abstract = {Enpp1 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that regulates bone mineralization by hydrolyzing extracellular nucleotide triphosphates to produce pyrophosphate. Enpp1 dysfunction causes human diseases characterized by ectopic calcification. Enpp1 also inhibits insulin signaling, and an Enpp1 polymorphism is associated with insulin resistance. However, the precise mechanism by which Enpp1 functions in these cellular processes remains elusive. Here, we report the crystal structures of the extracellular region of mouse Enpp1 in complex with four different nucleotide monophosphates, at resolutions of 2.7-3.2 \AA. The nucleotides are accommodated in a pocket formed by an insertion loop in the catalytic domain, explaining the preference of Enpp1 for an ATP substrate. Structural mapping of disease-associated mutations indicated the functional importance of the interdomain interactions. A structural comparison of Enpp1 with Enpp2, a lysophospholipase D, revealed marked differences in the domain arrangements and active-site architectures. Notably, the Enpp1 mutant lacking the insertion loop lost the nucleotide-hydrolyzing activity but instead gained the lysophospholipid-hydrolyzing activity of Enpp2. Our findings provide structural insights into how the Enpp family proteins evolved to exert their diverse cellular functions.},

abstract = {Medial vascular calcification (MVC) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease, obesity, and aging. MVC is an actively regulated process that resembles skeletal mineralization, resulting from chondro-osteogenic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Here, we used mineralizing murine VSMCs to study the expression of PHOSPHO1, a phosphatase that participates in the first step of matrix vesicles-mediated initiation of mineralization during endochondral ossification. Wild-type (WT) VSMCs cultured under calcifying conditions exhibited increased Phospho1 gene expression and Phospho1(-/-) VSMCs failed to mineralize in vitro. Using natural PHOSPHO1 substrates, potent and specific inhibitors of PHOSPHO1 were identified via high-throughput screening and mechanistic analysis and two of these inhibitors, designated MLS-0390838 and MLS-0263839, were selected for further analysis. Their effectiveness in preventing VSMC calcification by targeting PHOSPHO1 function was assessed, alone and in combination with a potent tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) inhibitor MLS-0038949. PHOSPHO1 inhibition by MLS-0263839 in mineralizing WT cells (cultured with added inorganic phosphate) reduced calcification in culture to 41.8\% ± 2.0\% of control. Combined inhibition of PHOSPHO1 by MLS-0263839 and TNAP by MLS-0038949 significantly reduced calcification to 20.9\% ± 0.74\% of control. Furthermore, the dual inhibition strategy affected the expression of several mineralization-related enzymes while increasing expression of the smooth muscle cell marker Acta2. We conclude that PHOSPHO1 plays a critical role in VSMC mineralization and that "phosphatase inhibition" may be a useful therapeutic strategy to reduce MVC.},

abstract = {To investigate the role of adenosine formed extracellularly in vascular homeostasis, mice with a targeted deletion of the cd73/ecto-5'-nucleotidase were generated. Southern blot, RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis confirmed the constitutive knockout. In vivo analysis of hemodynamic parameters revealed no significant differences in systolic blood pressure, ejection fraction, or cardiac output between strains. However, basal coronary flow measured in the isolated perfused heart was significantly lower (-14\%; P<0.05) in the mutant. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong CD73 expression on the endothelium of conduit vessels in wild-type (WT) mice. Time to carotid artery occlusion after ferric chloride (FeCl3) was significantly reduced by 20\% in cd73-/- mice (P<0.05). Bleeding time after tail tip resection tended to be shorter in cd73-/- mice (-35\%). In vivo platelet cAMP levels were 0.96+/-0.46 in WT versus 0.68+/-0.27 pmol/106 cells in cd73-/- mice (P<0.05). Under in vitro conditions, platelet aggregation in response to ADP (0.05 to 10 micromol/L) was undistinguishable between the two strains. In the cremaster model of ischemia-reperfusion, the increase in leukocyte attachment to endothelium was significantly higher in cd73-/- compared with WT littermates (WT 98\% versus cd73-/- 245\%; P<0.005). The constitutive adhesion of monocytes in ex vivo-perfused carotid arteries of WT mice was negligible but significantly increased in arteries of cd73-/- mice (P<0.05). Thus, our data provide the first evidence that adenosine, extracellularly formed by CD73, can modulate coronary vascular tone, inhibit platelet activation, and play an important role in leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium in vivo.},

PXE is caused by mutations in ABCC6, a gene encoding an ABC transporter predominantly expressed in liver and kidneys. The functional relationship between ABCC6 and elastic fiber calcification is unknown. We speculated that ABCC6 deficiency in PXE patients induces a persistent imbalance in circulating metabolite(s), which may impair the synthetic abilities of normal elastoblasts or specifically alter elastic fiber assembly. Therefore, we compared the deposition of elastic fiber proteins in cultures of fibroblasts derived from PXE and unaffected individuals. PXE fibroblasts cultured with normal human serum expressed and deposited increased amounts of proteins, but structurally normal elastic fibers. Interestingly, normal and PXE fibroblasts as well as normal smooth muscle cells deposited abnormal aggregates of elastic fibers when maintained in the presence of serum from PXE patients. The expression of tropoelastin and other elastic fiber-associated genes was not significantly modulated by the presence of PXE serum. These results indicated that certain metabolites present in PXE sera interfered with the normal assembly of elastic fibers in vitro and suggested that PXE is a primary metabolic disorder with secondary connective tissue manifestations.},

abstract = {Abnormal mineralization occurs in the context of several common conditions, including advanced age, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal failure, and certain genetic conditions. Metabolic, mechanical, infectious, and inflammatory injuries promote ectopic mineralization through overlapping yet distinct molecular mechanisms of initiation and progression. The ABCC6 protein is an ATP-dependent transporter primarily found in the plasma membrane of hepatocytes. ABCC6 exports unknown substrates from the liver presumably for systemic circulation. ABCC6 deficiency is the primary cause for chronic and acute forms of ectopic mineralization described in diseases such as pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), $\beta$-thalassemia, and generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) in humans and dystrophic cardiac calcification (DCC) in mice. These pathologies are characterized by mineralization of cardiovascular, ocular, and dermal tissues. PXE and to an extent GACI are caused by inactivating ABCC6 mutations, whereas the mineralization associated with $\beta$-thalassemia patients derives from a liver-specific change in ABCC6 expression. DCC is an acquired phenotype resulting from cardiovascular insults (ischemic injury or hyperlipidemia) and secondary to ABCC6 insufficiency. Abcc6-deficient mice develop ectopic calcifications similar to both the human PXE and mouse DCC phenotypes. The precise molecular and cellular mechanism linking deficient hepatic ABCC6 function to distal ectopic mineral deposition is not understood and has captured the attention of many research groups. Our previously published work along with that of others show that ABCC6 influences other modulators of calcification and that it plays a much greater physiological role than originally thought.},

In this regard, the 5' nuclease, or TaqMan, PCR assay is especially attractive. A fluorogenic probe, consisting of an oligonucleotide labeled with both a fluorescent reporter dye and a quencher dye, is included in a typical PCR. Amplification of the probe-specific product causes cleavage of the probe, generating an increase in reporter fluorescence. By using different reporter dyes, cleavage of allele-specific probes can be detected in a single PCR. The 5' nuclease assay has been successfully used to discriminate alleles that differ by a single base substitution. Guidelines have been developed so that an assay for any single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can be quickly designed and implemented. All assays are performed using a single reaction buffer and single thermocycling protocol. Furthermore, a standard method of analysis has been developed that enables automated genotype determination. Applications of this assay have included typing a number of polymorphisms in human drug metabolism genes.},

abstract = {Arterial Calcification due to Deficiency of CD73 (ACDC) results from mutations in the NT5E gene encoding the 5' exonucleotidase, CD73. We now describe the third familial case of ACDC, including radiological and histopathological details of the arterial calcifications. The medial lesions involve the entire circumference of the elastic lamina, in contrast to the intimal plaque-like disease of atherosclerosis. The demonstration of broken and fragmented elastic fibers leading to generalized vascular calcification suggests an analogy to pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), which exhibits similar histopathology. Classical PXE is caused by deficiency of ABCC6, a C type ABC transporter whose ligand is unknown. Other C type ABC proteins transport nucleotides, so the newly described role of adenosine in inhibiting vascular calcification, along with the similarity of ACDC and PXE with respect to vascular pathology, suggests that adenosine may be the ligand for ABCC6.},

Bone and cartilage tissue as well as osteoblast- and chondrocyte-like cells are present in calcified arteries. As in bone formation, apoptosis and matrix vesicles play an important role in the initiation of vascular calcification. Recent evidence indicates that nanocrystals initially formed in the vessel wall may actively be involved in the progression of the calcification process. This review focuses on the cellular and structural similarities between bone formation and vascular calcification and discusses the initial events in this pathological mineralization process.},

abstract = {Spontaneous pathologic arterial calcifications in childhood can occur in generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) or in pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). GACI is associated with biallelic mutations in ENPP1 in the majority of cases, whereas mutations in ABCC6 are known to cause PXE. However, the genetic basis in subsets of both disease phenotypes remains elusive. We hypothesized that GACI and PXE are in a closely related spectrum of disease. We used a standardized questionnaire to retrospectively evaluate the phenotype of 92 probands with a clinical history of GACI. We obtained the ENPP1 genotype by conventional sequencing. In those patients with less than two disease-causing ENPP1 mutations, we sequenced ABCC6. We observed that three GACI patients who carried biallelic ENPP1 mutations developed typical signs of PXE between 5 and 8 years of age; these signs included angioid streaks and pseudoxanthomatous skin lesions. In 28 patients, no disease-causing ENPP1 mutation was found. In 14 of these patients, we detected pathogenic ABCC6 mutations (biallelic mutations in eight patients, monoallelic mutations in six patients). Thus, ABCC6 mutations account for a significant subset of GACI patients, and ENPP1 mutations can also be associated with PXE lesions in school-aged children. Based on the considerable overlap of genotype and phenotype of GACI and PXE, both entities appear to reflect two ends of a clinical spectrum of ectopic calcification and other organ pathologies, rather than two distinct disorders. ABCC6 and ENPP1 mutations might lead to alterations of the same physiological pathways in tissues beyond the artery.},

Insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to arterial calcification has come from genetic studies on four rare monogenic disorders. The disease-causing molecular defects in generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), calcification of joints and arteries (CALJA), and familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC) have been identified within recent years. Based on the similarities of GACI, PXE, CALJA, and IBGC, it can be speculated that the underlying disease genes-ENPP1, ABCC6, NT5E, and SLC20A2, respectively-drive a cohesive molecular pathophysiology system modulated by ATP metabolism, inorganic pyrophosphate, adenosine, and inorganic phosphate generation and functional activities.},

abstract = {Vascular calcification is common in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and is associated with poorer outcomes. Although the pathophysiology is not completely understood, it is clear that it is a multifactorial process involving altered mineral metabolism, as well as changes in systemic and local factors that can promote or inhibit vascular calcification, and all of these are potential therapeutic targets. Current therapy is closely linked to strategies for preventing disordered bone and mineral metabolism in advanced kidney disease and involves lowering the circulating levels of both phosphate and calcium. The efficacy of compounds that specifically target calcification, such as bisphosphonates and thiosulfate, has been shown in animals but only in small numbers of humans, and safety remains an issue. Additional therapies, such as pyrophosphate, vitamin K, and lowering of pH, are supported by animal studies, but are yet to be investigated clinically. As the mineral composition of vascular calcifications is the same as in bone, potential effects on bone must be addressed with any therapy for vascular calcification.},

abstract = {The signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins are a small family of signaling proteins that are crucial for cytokine and growth factor receptor-mediated signaling in various blood cell types. Despite their central role in immune and hematopoietic cellular regulation, there are relatively few options for monitoring receptor-mediated JAK/STAT signaling events in a cell-based format, without the need for cellular transfections or labor intensive methodology. Indeed, traditional methods such as the Western blot or ELISA remain a standard method for determining the phosphorylation status of endogenous STAT proteins. Here we present data for the rapid detection of endogenous receptor-mediated phosphorylation of multiple STAT proteins using the bead-based AlphaScreen SureFire technology. With three different cell lines (human acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells, human erythroleukemic TF-1 cells, and human T lymphocytic Jurkat cells), we have optimized a rapid and homogeneous methodology for monitoring endogenous, receptor-mediated signaling via STAT 1, STAT 3, or STAT 5 phosphorylation, in response to several agonists. These assays, which can be tailored for both standard research applications or high-throughput drug screening applications, afford quantitative data for receptor-mediated signaling mechanisms in an endogenous, cellular environment.},

abstract = {Aims The association between alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and mortality was reported in several subgroups of patients. But, the role of ALP in overall coronary artery disease (CAD) patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic value of the ALP level in patients with CAD who underwent PCI with drug-eluting stent (DES). Methods and results We prospectively included CAD patients who underwent PCI with DES. After exclusion of patients with liver disease and cancer, 1636 patients were selected for the analysis of clinical outcomes (median duration of follow-up; 762 days, inter-quartile range; 494-1068 days), and were classified into tertiles by baseline measurements of ALP (<63, 63-78, and >78 IU/L). After adjustment of potential confounders including angiographic data, the independent and dose-dependent association was observed between tertile of ALP and the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause mortality (P for trend < 0.0001). Specifically, compared with the lowest ALP tertile, the adjusted HR of all-cause mortality in the highest tertile was 4.21 (95\% confidence interval 2.03-8.71). In subgroup of patients with stable or unstable angina, a similar association was noted (P for trend < 0.0001). In terms of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis, the adjusted HRs in the highest ALP tertile were 3.92 (1.37-11.20), 1.98 (0.91-4.29), and 2.73 (1.33-5.61), respectively, compared with the lowest tertile. Furthermore, evaluation of both ALP and C-reactive protein provided better predictive value than either alone. Interesting result suggesting the mechanism was that ALP was significantly associated with the presence of angiographic coronary calcification (P for trend = 0.046). Conclusion Our study demonstrated that the higher serum ALP level is an independent predictor of mortality, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis in CAD patients after PCI with DES.},

Moreover, we characterize the biochemical properties and enzyme activities from synaptosomes of the nerve terminal endings of heart left ventricle. We observe divalent cation-dependent enzymes that presented optimum pH of 8.0 for ATP and ADP hydrolysis, and 9.5 for AMP hydrolysis. The apparent K(M) values are 40 microM, 90 microM and 39 microM and apparent V(max) values are 537, 219 and 111 nmol Pi released/min/mg of protein for ATP, ADP and AMP hydrolysis, respectively. Ouabain, orthovanadate, NEM, lanthanum and levamisole do not affect ATP and ADP hydrolysis in rat cardiac synaptosomes. Oligomycin (2 microg/mL) and sodium azide (0.1 mM), both mitochondrial ATPase inhibitors, inhibit only the ATP hydrolysis. High concentrations of sodium azide and gadolinium chloride show an inhibition on both, ATP and ADP hydrolysis. Suramin inhibit more strongly ATP hydrolysis than ADP hydrolysis whereas Evans blue almost abolish both hydrolysis. AMP hydrolysis is not affected by levamisole and tetramisole, whereas 0.1 mM ammonium molybdate practically abolish the ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity. RT-PCR analysis from left ventricle tissue demonstrate different levels of expression of Entpd1 (Cd39), Entpd2 (Cd39L1), Entpd3 (Cd39L3), Entpd5 (Cd39L4) Entpd6, (Cd39L2) and 5'-NT/CD73.

We review how genetic factors, as identified by human genome-wide association studies, and incomplete correlations with various mouse studies, including knockout and strain analyses, fit into "pieces of the puzzle" in intimal calcification in human atherosclerosis, and artery tunica media calcification in aging, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. We also describe in sharp contrast how ENPP1, CD73, and ABCC6 serve as "cogs in a wheel" of arterial calcification. Specifically, each is a minor component in the function of a much larger network of factors that exert balanced effects to promote and suppress arterial calcification. For the network to normally suppress spontaneous arterial calcification, the "cogs" ENPP1, CD73, and ABCC6 must be present and in working order. Monogenic ENPP1, CD73, and ABCC6 deficiencies each drive a molecular pathophysiology of closely related but phenotypically different diseases (generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) and arterial calcification caused by CD73 deficiency (ACDC)), in which premature onset arterial calcification is a prominent but not the sole feature.},

abstract = {Idiopathic infantile arterial calcification (IIAC; OMIM 208000) is characterized by calcification of the internal elastic lamina of muscular arteries and stenosis due to myointimal proliferation. We analyzed affected individuals from 11 unrelated kindreds and found that IIAC was associated with mutations that inactivated ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1). This cell surface enzyme generates inorganic pyrophosphate (PP(i)), a solute that regulates cell differentiation and serves as an essential physiologic inhibitor of calcification.},

abstract = {Vascular calcification, a prevalent and progressive disorder, involves numerous interactive, autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine regulatory mechanisms and is thus ideally suited for analysis using a systems approach. This approach focuses on creating quantitative, testable models of complex biological systems that take into consideration the time dimension. They are usually expressed as mathematical models, and because of their time dependence and complexity, they usually require computer simulation to determine predicted outcomes. Here, we provide an example of such a model used to analyze self-organization and mineralization of vascular stem cells, using partial differential equations capable of accurately predicting experimental outcomes. Such systems-based models are useful in many aspects of cardiovascular medicine.},

abstract = {Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is actively released in the extracellular environment in response to tissue damage and cellular stress. Through the activation of P2X and P2Y receptors, extracellular ATP enhances tissue repair, promotes the recruitment of immune phagocytes and dendritic cells, and acts as a co-activator of NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes. The conversion of extracellular ATP to adenosine, in contrast, essentially through the enzymatic activity of the ecto-nucleotidases CD39 and CD73, acts as a negative-feedback mechanism to prevent excessive immune responses. Here we review the effects of extracellular ATP and adenosine on tumorigenesis. First, we summarize the functions of extracellular ATP and adenosine in the context of tumor immunity. Second, we present an overview of the immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic effects of extracellular adenosine. Third, we present experimental evidence that extracellular ATP and adenosine receptors are expressed by tumor cells and enhance tumor growth. Finally, we discuss recent studies, including our own work, which suggest that therapeutic approaches that promote ATP-mediated activation of inflammasomes, or inhibit the accumulation of tumor-derived extracellular adenosine, may constitute effective new means to induce anticancer activity.},

abstract = {CD731 is a GPI-anchored cell surface protein with ecto-5'-nucleotidase enzyme activity that plays a crucial role in adenosine production. While the roles of adenosine receptors (AR) on osteoblasts and osteoclasts have been unveiled to some extent, the roles of CD73 and CD73-generated adenosine in bone tissue are largely unknown. To address this issue, we first analyzed the bone phenotype of CD73-deficient (cd73(-/-)) mice. The mutant male mice showed osteopenia, with significant decreases of osteoblastic markers. Levels of osteoclastic markers were, however, comparable to those of wild-type mice. A series of in vitro studies revealed that CD73 deficiency resulted in impairment in osteoblast differentiation but not in the number of osteoblast progenitors. In addition, over expression of CD73 on MC3T3-E1 cells resulted in enhanced osteoblastic differentiation. Moreover, MC3T3-E1 cells expressed adenosine A(2A) receptors (A(2A)AR) and A(2B) receptors (A(2B)AR) and expression of these receptors increased with osteoblastic differentiation. Enhanced expression of osteocalcin (OC) and bone sialoprotein (BSP) observed in MC3T3-E1 cells over expressing CD73 were suppressed by treatment with an A(2B)AR antagonist but not with an A(2A) AR antagonist. Collectively, our results indicate that CD73 generated adenosine positively regulates osteoblast differentiation via A(2B)AR signaling.},

abstract = {Extracellular adenosine has been widely implicated in adaptive responses to hypoxia. The generation of extracellular adenosine involves phosphohydrolysis of adenine nucleotide intermediates, and is regulated by the terminal enzymatic step catalyzed by ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73). Guided by previous work indicating that hypoxia-induced vascular leakage is, at least in part, controlled by adenosine, we generated mice with a targeted disruption of the third coding exon of Cd73 to test the hypothesis that CD73-generated extracellular adenosine functions in an innate protective pathway for hypoxia-induced vascular leakage. Cd73(-/-) mice bred and gained weight normally, and appeared to have an intact immune system. However, vascular leakage was significantly increased in multiple organs, and after subjection to normobaric hypoxia (8\% O(2)), Cd73(-/-) mice manifested fulminant vascular leakage, particularly prevalent in the lung. Histological examination of lungs from hypoxic Cd73(-/-) mice revealed perivascular interstitial edema associated with inflammatory infiltrates surrounding larger pulmonary vessels. Vascular leakage secondary to hypoxia was reversed in part by adenosine receptor agonists or reconstitution with soluble 5'-nucleotidase. Together, our studies identify CD73 as a critical mediator of vascular leakage in vivo.},

The classic forms of PXE are due to loss-of-function mutations in the ABCC6 gene, which encodes ABCC6, a putative transmembrane efflux transporter expressed primarily in the liver. While considerable progress has recently been made in understanding the molecular genetics and pathomechanisms of PXE, no effective or specific treatment is currently available for this disorder. PXE International, the premiere patient advocacy organization, organized a workshop in November 2010 to assess the current state of diagnostics and research to develop an agenda towards treatment of PXE. This overview summarizes the progress in PXE research, with emphasis on molecular therapies for this, currently intractable, disorder.},

abstract = {The aortic heart valve undergoes geometric and mechanical changes over time. The cusps of a normal, healthy valve thicken and become less extensible over time. In the disease calcific aortic stenosis (CAS), calcified nodules progressively stiffen the cusps. The local mechanical changes in the cusps, due to either normal aging or pathological processes, affect overall function of the valve. In this paper, we propose a computational model for the aging aortic valve that connects local changes to overall valve function. We extend a previous model for the healthy valve to describe aging. To model normal/uncomplicated aging, leaflet thickness and extensibility are varied versus age according to experimental data. To model calcification, initial sites are defined and a simple growth law is assumed. The nodules then grow over time, so that the area of calcification increases from one model to the next model representing greater age. Overall valve function is recorded for each individual model to yield a single simulation of valve function over time. This simulation is the first theoretical tool to describe the temporal behavior of aortic valve calcification. The ability to better understand and predict disease progression will aid in design and timing of patient treatments for CAS.},

abstract = {A nonradioactive glycosyltransferase assay is described here. This method takes advantage of specific phosphatases that can be added into glycosyltransferase reactions to quantitatively release inorganic phosphate from the leaving groups of glycosyltransferase reactions. The released phosphate group is then detected using colorimetric malachite-based reagents. Because the amount of phosphate released is directly proportional to the sugar molecule transferred in a glycosyltransferase reaction, this method can be used to obtain accurate kinetic parameters of the glycosyltransferase. The assay can be performed in multiwell plates and quantitated by a plate reader, thus making it amenable to high-throughput screening. It has been successfully applied to all glycosyltransferases available to us, including glucosyltransferases, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, N-acetylgalactosyltransferases, galactosyltransferases, fucosyltransferases and sialyltransferases. As examples, we first assayed Clostridium difficile toxin B, a protein O-glucosyltransferase that specifically monoglucosylates and inactivates Rho family small GTPases; we then showed that human KTELC1, a homolog of Rumi from Drosophila, was able to hydrolyze UDP-Glc; and finally, we measured the kinetic parameters of human sialyltransferase ST6GAL1.},

abstract = {E-NTPDases are extracellular enzymes that hydrolyze nucleotides. The human E-NTPDase gene family currently consists of five reported members (CD39, CD39L1, CD39L2, CD39L3, and CD39L4). Both membrane-bound and secreted family members have been predicted by encoded transmembrane and leader peptide motifs. In this report, we demonstrate that the human CD39L2 gene is expressed predominantly in the heart. In situ hybridization results from heart indicate that the CD39L2 message is expressed in muscle and capillary endothelial cells. We also show that the CD39L2 gene encodes an extracellular E-NTPDase. Flow cytometric experiments show that transiently expressed CD39L2 is present on the surface of COS-7 cells. Transfected cells also produce recombinant glycosylated protein in the medium, and this process can be blocked by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of the mammalian secretory pathway. The enzymology of CD39L2 shows characteristic features of a typical E-NTPDase, but with a much higher degree of specificity for NDPs over NTPs as enzymatic substrates. The kinetics of the ADPase activity exhibit positive cooperativity. The predominance of CD39L2 expression in the heart supports a functional role in regulating platelet activation and recruitment in this organ.},

A review of the hemodynamic impact of arterial stiffness follows. A number of lifestyle changes and therapies that reduce arterial stiffness are presented, including weight loss, exercise, salt reduction, alcohol consumption, and neuroendocrine-directed therapies, such as those targeting the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, natriuretic peptides, insulin modulators, as well as novel therapies that target advanced glycation end products.},
