# Abstract and Specific Aims

Vascular calcification in both the intima and media of vessels is associated
with increase risk for cardiac events and mortality. Given the significant
clinical impact of arterial calcification, the mechanism and genetic basis
behind its clinical presentation has been a subject of intense study.

Recently, the human gene *NT53* that encodes CD73, the enzyme responsible for
converting extracellular AMP to adenosine, has been implicated as a key
component behind the metabolic pathway for inhibiting ectopic tissue
calcification. Individuals with mutations in NT5E result in an arterial disease
phenotype of arterial calcification and distal joint calcification (ACDC). As
of the writing of this proposal, there is no standard treatment or therapy for
alleviating this condition.

This study proposes the development of a quantitative systems model, built
alongside *in vitro* and murine disease model experimentation, for elucidating
the mechanism behind the presentation of ACDC. This model will enable the
in-depth investigation of the ectopic tissue calcification pathway and useful
for predicting the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions, which will be
confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, two other potential pieces to this
biological process have been identified in the literature, ENPP1 and ABCC6,
which when deficient cause generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI)
and pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), respectively. These two components will be
integrated into the *in silico* model.

## Specific Aim 1: **Develop *In Vitro* Model of Arterial Calcification.**

* Develop assay to check for expression levels of CD73, ENPP1, and ABCC6.
* CD73 and ENPP1 are likely to be expressed in fibroblasts, but ABCC6 will
  likely need to be transfected and expressed.
* Confirm that all three receptors are expressed.  Replicate disease states by
  blocking individual enzymes with antibodies.

Alternatives:

* Forget about ABCC6 and use serum from ABCC6 -/-
* Try different cell lines

## Specific Aim 2:  **Build Quantitative Systems Model of Arterial
Calcification.**

* Fit to ODE model
* Quantify enzymes levels
* Determine enzyme kinetics: Initial rate reaction assay by blocking enzyme
  activity with antibodies

Alternatives:

* Use NMR
* Try reversible hill equation instead of Michaelis-Menten

## Specific Aim 3: **Investigate Potential Therapeutic Interventions for
Treating NT5E *In Vitro* and *In Silico* Along with Extrapolating the Results
for *In Vivo* Study in an Established Murine Model.**

* Use animal model: CD73 -/- mice.
* Compare *in silico* and *in vivo* results when treated with: bisphosphonates
  ($PP_i$ analog), adenosine analogs, lansoprazole (inhibitor of TNAP),
  Dipyridamole (inhibits adenosine uptake)

# Exam Question

William Gahl, the NIH sleuth who has identified a number of rare diseases,
recently found that deletion of the gene NT5E led to calcification in leg
arteries, to arterial insufficiency, and to inability to walk. The gene codes
for an ecto-5'-nucleotidase, CD73. Write a proposal to support research to
define the mechanisms by which the genetic abnormality causes the disease, and
to find out how one can treat the disease. (St.Hilaire C, Ziegler SG, Markello
